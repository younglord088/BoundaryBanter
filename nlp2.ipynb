              "\"8.55am Good morning and welcome to our coverage of the second semi-final between Australia and South Africa, with the winners taking on Sri Lanka in Saturday's final. Team and toss news to follow any second ... Bracken to Smith, 1 run uppish and loose pushed drive, in the air but into space, third man fields Bracken to de Villiers, no run wide of off stump, plenty of swing, aided by a stiff breeze, and de Villiers leaves Bracken to de Villiers, no run again that swung into the right-hander, de Villiers into line and drops into the leg side Bracken to de Villiers, no run a similar line, de Villiers pushes the ball no more than five or six yards into the leg side Bracken to de Villiers, no run outside off and wide enough to leave Bracken to de Villiers, FOUR runs de Villiers pushes forward, a thick edge shoots along the ground to the right of solitary slip and the ball flies across the outfield McGrath to Smith, 1 run Smith whips that from middle-and-leg into the on side, an easy run to the man in the deep McGrath to de Villiers, 1 wide that started wide of off and swung significantly, an easy wide to call and Gilchrist had to scurry across to gather McGrath to de Villiers, no run better line, and less swing, de Villiers leaves it alone McGrath to de Villiers, no run massive shout as de Villiers took a half stride and misses. Aleem Dar shakes his head McGrath to de Villiers, no run outside off and no alarms this time as the batsman leaves it McGrath to de Villiers, no run McGrath finds the edge and it drops just short of Ponting at second slip Bracken to Smith, no run Smith takes a stroll down the pitch before Bracken is even in his delivery stride, prods and misses Bracken to Smith, no run this time Smith stays anchored to the crease and pushes into the covers Bracken to Smith, OUT Smith again walks down the pitch to meet the ball, shapes to hit over the top and a sniff of swing takes the ball past the bat and into the off stump Bracken to Kallis, no run Kallis spars and misses one outside off, much oohing and aahing among players, crowd and Cricinfo staff. 79mph for speed freaks. Bracken to Kallis, no run wider, and Kallis able to watch that pass Bracken to Kallis, no run 82mph, and Kallis plays a slightly hurried defensive jab McGrath to de Villiers, no run wide and left McGrath to de Villiers, no run McGrath continues with his nagging line fractionally outside off - 79mph - and de Villiers not tempted to nibble ... yet McGrath to de Villiers, no run fractionally too wide, and McGrath looks to the heavens as he knows that's not quite the right line McGrath to de Villiers, no run quicker - 83mph - and de Villiers drawn forward and then leaves with a theatrical flourish McGrath to de Villiers, no run pushed defensive shot, a thick inside edge and the ball dribbles into the leg side McGrath to de Villiers, no run on target, de Villiers into line and plays into the leg side Bracken to Kallis, no run punched off the back foot into the covers, and all with one hand as the bottom one slips off the handle as he plays the stroke Bracken to Kallis, no run a strangled appeal as the ball hits Kallis high on the pad ... he had taken two big steps down the pitch Bracken to Kallis, 1 run a rather limp drive between cover fielders, muted cheers and a solitary horn welcome the run to the man in the deep Bracken to de Villiers, no run a grunt from Bracken, and then a delivery wide off off stump which de Villiers leaves Bracken to de Villiers, no run de Villiers back, into line, and blocks into the off Bracken to de Villiers, no run another good over ends with a leave from de Villiers McGrath to Kallis, no run Kallis not remotely tempted as the ball passes by and Gilchrist takes by his feet McGrath to Kallis, FOUR runs Kallis dances down the track, McGrath sees him step to leg, follows him, but Kallis still punches that past extra cover McGrath to Kallis, OUT Kallis again gives himself room and advances to meet the ball, but McGrath fires in a yorker which clatters into the off stump McGrath to Gibbs, no run 84mph from McGrath. Either the old man is fired up or, as has happened a few times, the speed gun is up the creek. Anyhow, outside off and Gibbs watches and leaves McGrath to Gibbs, 1 run half-volley outside off, driven to Hogg at mid-off and they scurry through for a quick single McGrath to de Villiers, FOUR runs McGrath drops short, de Villiers on it in a flash and smashes that past a diving short midwicket. That was really clobbered Bracken to Gibbs, 1 run wide and a slashed drive races to deep backward point Bracken to de Villiers, 1 run pushed to mid-on, Watson picks up and throws at the bowler's end, de Villiers was out had the ball hit. At 18 for 2, that was just daft Bracken to Gibbs, no run left alone Bracken to Gibbs, 1 run Gibbs shapes to flick to leg, gets a thick edge via pad, and the ball plops into the on side Bracken to de Villiers, no run de Villiers happy to leave one a foot outside the off Bracken to de Villiers, 1 run driven firmly to the left of mid-off, and that placement allows for the easy single McGrath to de Villiers, no run McGrath starts his fourth over with a loosener outside off McGrath to de Villiers, no run slightly closer to the off stump but again the batsman not lured into anything McGrath to de Villiers, no run pushed into the off side, pounced on like a fly in a Venus thingytrap McGrath to de Villiers, no run Glichrist takes that as de Villiers ushers it by McGrath to de Villiers, no run stock McGrath delivery, niggly and just outside off McGrath to de Villiers, 1 run de Villiers leaps out of his crease to meet the ball and square drives to the sweeper Tait to de Villiers, FOUR runs Tait opens with a bouncer at 88mph, and it's almost as if de Villiers has been sent advanced notice, he's on it so fast and hammers that over midwicket Tait to de Villiers, no run fired in at almost 93mph and de Villiers blocks off the back foot Tait to de Villiers, no run slower ball - 91.9mph - and de Villiers is almost early on the attempted pull. It did keep low outside off ... Tait to de Villiers, no run short - another 90mph+ delivery - and de Villiers sways back just in case Tait to de Villiers, OUT full, de Villiers drives with no foot movement, and a thick kick carries straight to Gilchrist. A fourth delivery over 90mph, a good mixture of length, and now South Africa are up against it Tait to Prince, no run right back and drops the ball at his feet McGrath to Gibbs, no run McGrath seems almost a spinner after watching Tait ... good line, good length and defended McGrath to Gibbs, no run Gibbs thrusts his pad down the pitch, covering any movement, and then opts to leave McGrath to Gibbs, 1 run McGrath drifts to leg - seriously - and Gibbs turns the ball just in front of square McGrath to Prince, OUT And that might be it ... about the worst ball McGrath has bowled, wide and angled away from the left-hander, but Prince slashes, gets a thin edge, and Gilchrist does the rest McGrath to Boucher, OUT McGrath on a hat-trick ... much better ball, a stock McGrath delivery, Boucher plays a nothing prod and the ball is held low down by Matthew Hayden at first slip McGrath to Kemp, no run oh my goodness ... Kemp leaves and the ball passes knee-shakingly close to his off stump. Good judgment ... but a great over from McGrath. Tait to Gibbs, no run and another! But Bucknor doesn't raise his finger. A fierce inswinger as Gibbs goes right back, inside edges it to Gilchrist who tumbles to his left but...Bucknor refuses to raise his finger Tait to Gibbs, FOUR runs and he crashes this on the front foot but it's just wide of the lone slip - and I reiterate, there's just one slip in there Tait to Gibbs, FOUR runs fabulous shot. The most textbook of cover drives, creaming it on the front foot through extra cover Tait to Gibbs, no run ooh well bowled, Tait, cutting this back into Gibbs who is back into his crease - rather late on it - defending off the back foot Tait to Gibbs, no run shorter this time from Tait, and he grunts in doing so, forcing Gibbs back into his crease and he defends off the back foot Tait to Gibbs, no run very well bowled from Tait, who has so far been far from the scattergun. In fact, he's been sniper-like: a 93.4mph (150ish kph) inswinger which Gibbs is very late on, nudging it to leg McGrath to Kemp, 1 run Short and quick from McGrath McGrath to Gibbs, no run classic McGrath, cutting this back into him and it's defended solidly McGrath to Gibbs, no run right in the channel there, absolutely perfect line just outside off stump and he comes forward, rather tentatively, defending it back to McGrath McGrath to Gibbs, no run and McGrath is in once again, chugging up to the crease and again lands it on a sixpenny and Gibbs is forced to block it out on the front foot McGrath to Gibbs, no run ever so slightly wider from McGrath - the teaser McGrath to Gibbs, no run Gibbs again leaves it alone outside off Tait to Kemp, 1 leg bye Another prehistoric grunt from Tait as he flings this down - but it's a little too straight and worked off his pads Tait to Gibbs, FOUR runs outside off, Gibbs plants his foot and slashes it over the slips - not far off at all Tait to Gibbs, no run ah, very good comeback from Tait just pitching it up a smidgen more Tait to Gibbs, 1 run oh hello, a Tait slower ball. That's new - or at least, I've not seen it much before. Gibbs reads it, though, and on the front foot neatly guides it down to third man with surprising deftness Tait to Kemp, 5 wide oh dear, Tait's replaced his sniper rifle with the greater-spotted potato gun. This is miles down the leg side and Gilchrist doesn't have a chance Tait to Kemp, no run on off stump this time, much better, and it's firmly defended Tait to Kemp, no run cracking ball, at high pace, swinging into the right hander who digs it out at the very last moment. A yorker, in fact Bracken to Gibbs, 1 run and he starts lazily, drifting it down the leg side and Gibbs plucks it with ease to leg Bracken to Kemp, 1 run ooh close! A lovely delivery angling across a very nervous Justin Kemp who, even more nervously, pushes forward without conviction and edges it past the second slip Bracken to Gibbs, no run defended on the front foot Bracken to Gibbs, 1 run ah, delightful shot, coming forward on the front foot and just working it - smudging it - through midwicket Bracken to Kemp, no run gets into a bit of a tangle, Kemp, here. A shorter delivery which rises up on him and he defends, using his chest Watson to Gibbs, FOUR runs what a magnificent shot from Gibbs, a flick behind square which beats the man at deep square leg Watson to Gibbs, no run and Gibbs drives with vast amounts of class here, but straight to cover Watson to Gibbs, no run much better from Watson - that's the length and it's pumped back to the bowler Watson to Gibbs, no run just a little wider this time from Watson and Gibbs is back-and-across, pushing it out to cover Watson to Gibbs, 1 run a Watson slower-ball which is nicely nudged off the front foot down to fine leg Watson to Kemp, no run Kemp is less deft, but he defends with a solid lunge of the front foot and pushes this back to the bowler Hogg to Gibbs, no run quick, on middle-and-leg and it's worked further to leg Hogg to Gibbs, 1 run again on leg stump - quick and flat - turned around the corner Hogg to Kemp, no run well bowled, on middle stump and Kemp comes forward - massively - defending it on the front foot Hogg to Kemp, no run that's more like it from Kemp, hammering it on the front foot and timing it very well but straight to cover Hogg to Kemp, no run what a ball from the tongue-master, a wrong'un which Kemp complete misreads, coming forward, trying to defend, but missing it by a country mile Hogg to Kemp, no run and again he's beaten Watson to Gibbs, FOUR runs poor delivery, short and straight, Gibbs pulling it behind square Watson to Gibbs, no run better Watson to Gibbs, no run good idea from Watson, who increasingly resembles the incredible hulk, bouncing the batsman...but he's pretty settled now, ducking underneath it easily Watson to Gibbs, no run pushed back to the bowler and Gibbs gives him a stare. And why not? Watson to Gibbs, 1 run calmly strokes past short extra cover Watson to Kemp, 1 run on middle-and-off, Kemp lunges forward like a monster and defends Hogg to Kemp, 2 runs poor ball outside leg, deftly paddled around the corner Hogg to Kemp, 1 run very well played again, straighter this time and he plants his foot down the pitch and ladles it around the corner Hogg to Gibbs, 1 run flicked through midwicket Hogg to Kemp, no run blocked out on the front foot Hogg to Kemp, 1 run a full bunger from Hogg, punched through cover - rather takes Kemp by surprise, hence not trying to hit it into the USA Watson to Kemp, no run defended on the front foot Watson to Kemp, no run excellent ball on off stump and he comes forward to defend this out to cover Watson to Kemp, no run ah, now then - that's more like it from Watson. An excellent bouncer which takes the batsman by surprise, as he attempts to pull before deciding to leave it well alone Watson to Kemp, 2 runs Kemp late-cuts this with oodles of time, and class, behind point and wide of third man who sprints to his right to field Watson to Kemp, no run swinging into him, it's defended on the front foot Watson to Kemp, no run another good one just outside off. Watson bowling with excellent control so far and it's blocked out Hogg to Gibbs, 1 run on leg stump, picked off for a single Hogg to Kemp, no run ooh, this one holds up on him - just outside off, spinning back into him and jumping up a touch, it's blocked out Hogg to Kemp, no run full and straight, blocked out Hogg to Kemp, no run and he plays and misses outside off - the arm ball there Hogg to Kemp, 1 run on leg stump - flatter and quicker and defended Hogg to Gibbs, no run beaten! Terrific ball, the wrong'un which he plays at and misses, Hogg's tongue slavers around uncontrollably Watson to Kemp, no run on leg and that's skewed in front of square to the man there Watson to Kemp, no run slower ball, on the money, and that's defended forward Watson to Kemp, no run beautiful delivery that one, nipping back in at the righthander and threatening to kiss the outside edge Watson to Kemp, no run left alone this time Watson to Kemp, SIX runs short and Kemp's on that one so quickly, fending the ball with a hook right off his helmet - top work, that was close to him, and although he didn't get hold of it properlyit sailed away. And that's the fifty partnership Watson to Kemp, no run defended off the back foot into the covers Hogg to Gibbs, 1 run on leg, the batsman comes forward and sweeps that round on the front foot behind square Hogg to Kemp, 1 run swept that round behind square Hogg to Gibbs, no run the one that went the other way - the ball, not his tongue - and that slavers outside off and is left alone easily Hogg to Gibbs, 1 run another ball on leg, another sweep, this one dinked as gentle as the others Hogg to Kemp, 1 run on middle, doesn't read that one, and a tentative prod from Kemp sends an outside edge backward of point Hogg to Gibbs, 1 wide outside leg, chased round, and that's just to say wide Hogg to Gibbs, 1 run on leg and that turns towards leg even more, the batsman just poking that into short square Tait to Gibbs, no run bouncer, straight and high. Tait follows through with a serious look on his face - he means more business here all right Tait to Gibbs, FOUR runs outside off, way too much width and Gibbs just opens his shoulders and swings hard, and that one flies up off the base of the bat behind point, not quite where he intended it, but it fair raced away Tait to Gibbs, no run pushes him back up there to defend into the covers Tait to Gibbs, OUT got him this time! A very, very thin edge - much thinner than the one which wasn't given earlier, also to Tait - looking for the short-pitched delivery. His feet were just rooted in the crease there as he chased the ball away from his body Tait to Hall, no run good pace, right up there and scattering a cloud of dust as Hall edges that low, on the front foot, and unconvincingly down towards the slip region Hogg to Kemp, no run up there again, on middle, and that's defended once more, on the front foot again Hogg to Kemp, no run pitches on middle, moves to off and Kemp's not sure how to play that - he tries to sweep, doesn't really get hold of the ball Hogg to Kemp, no run defended again, Kemp not looking at all comfortable Hogg to Kemp, 1 wide wide down off, Kemp backs away to give himself room to cut, but that one went the other way and he was miles away from it Hogg to Kemp, 1 wide another wide down off. By George! Hogg can't believe that one - not sure why, it was very wide Hogg to Kemp, no run defended this time Hogg to Kemp, no run comes forward and defends that one on the front foot. Not much fuss about that shot Tait to Hall, no run awkward bounce to deal with that one, but Hall stays cool as ever defending down off the back foot Tait to Hall, 1 run gets his yorker line all wrong, and that's worked off the toes out to Mr Hussey-Cricket on the deep square boundary and he does a slide and relay with McGrath Tait to Kemp, no run left alone outside off this time Tait to Kemp, no run better yorker this time, obviously the length was right as before, but this time it was on the toes and that's just defended forward Tait to Kemp, no run bouncer down the channel and Kemp leaves that one alone Tait to Kemp, no run another bouncer, straight, and that's well avoided Hogg to Hall, no run tosses that one up, it dips naughtily at the last minute and the batsman rolls out a tame forward drive Hogg to Hall, 1 run swished off the toes to short midwicket Hogg to Kemp, no run right up there and there's a play and a miss Hogg to Kemp, 1 run some room outside off, the batsman waits and cuts that away into the covers with a mere tuck of a cut Hogg to Hall, 1 run turning away towards off again, this shot isn't so neat, an ugly chop down, yet again into the covers Tait to Nel, OUT short and wide, slashed high to backward point who backpeddled and took an easy catch above his head Tait to Kemp, no run slower ball - if you can describe 81mph as slower - and Langeveldt into line to block Tait to Kemp, no run faster and a bit shorter, Langeveldt sways out of the way. It probably would have missed him anyway Tait to Kemp, no run full, Langeveldt winds up and drives the ball to Hogg at mid-off Tait to Kemp, 1 wide Tait loses his bearings and spears one down the leg side Tait to Kemp, no run full and this time on target, Kemp defends Tait to Kemp, 1 run quite deliberately and safely steered down to third man. Kemp keeps the strike Watson to Kemp, FOUR runs Watson attempts the yorker, doesn't quite get it right and Kemp slams a full toss back over the bowler's head Watson to Kemp, 1 run full, driven almost as hard but there is a long-off in place Watson to Langeveldt, no run Langeveldt heads towards the square-leg umpire and blocks Watson to Langeveldt, 1 run decent ball which Langeveldt swings at, hits, and the ball arcs short of the man out in the deep on the off side Watson to Kemp, FOUR runs another full toss from Watson which Kemp absolutely smears through extra cover Watson to Kemp, no run slower ball but Kemp can't find the single he needs, leaving Langeveldt exposed Tait to Hall, OUT and Tait strikes again! Hall looked to lash that off the back foot through cover, but his feet must have been dipped in the same tub of superglue as Gibbs's as he strikes at the ball away from the body and a thickish edge rips through. Gilchrist makes no mistake Tait to Pollock, no run oh, Pollock was lucky to survive there, this one nipping back in off the seam and Pollock doing his valiant best to give Gilchrist another catching opportunity - but failed to get hold of it Tait to Pollock, no run right up there and that's poked into the covers. A bit of shuffling from Hogg in his sunhat as he takes his time to throw down the stumps. It looked in, and replays quickly confirmed it was Tait to Pollock, 1 run bouncer crashes into Pollock's gloves at just-crouching height - Pollock did well to shield his body there, but he's not looking comfortable Tait to Kemp, no run plays that away from his body, poking it down to gully off the back foot Tait to Kemp, no run more grunting from Tait, and that's up there, defended just outside off and just in front of yorker length Bracken to Pollock, no run he's over the wicket and that's defended forward first up Bracken to Pollock, no run across the righthander again and that's defended into the covers Bracken to Pollock, no run on middle and off, Pollock plays that into the covers in a very defensive manner Bracken to Pollock, no run straight, a touch short, and defended easily enough on the back foot this time Bracken to Pollock, no run outside off, Pollock tries to cut that off the back foot through point, but chops an inside edge down into the ground, safely enough Bracken to Langeveldt, 1 run Langeveldt drops into the leg side and runs. McGrath teapots that the No. 11 was allowed to get off strike first ball Bracken to Kemp, 1 run Kemp sweeps, Bracken appeals thinking it missed the bat, but Bucknor disagrees Bracken to Langeveldt, no run driven into the covers Bracken to Langeveldt, no run punched square on the off side Bracken to Langeveldt, no run Langeveldt misses with a swish to leg, strangled appeal as it again pitched outside the line Bracken to Langeveldt, no run defended into the off side, a quiet over but at least Kemp keeps the strike Watson to Kemp, no run Kemp heaves over midwicket to Hayden in the deep, but they decide not to run Watson to Kemp, 1 run driven straight to Tait at long-on, it went high but right to him. he caught it , dropped it, juggled the rebound before ending up in a big heap with the ball next to him Watson to Langeveldt, no run a big heave and a big miss Watson to Langeveldt, FOUR runs another heave from Langeveldt who is heading towards square leg as he plays it, over point and over the rope Watson to Langeveldt, OUT up in the block hole and Langeveldt, again giving himself room, is in no position to play it and is cleaned up Bracken to Smith, 1 run uppish and loose pushed drive, in the air but into space, third man fields Bracken to de Villiers, no run wide of off stump, plenty of swing, aided by a stiff breeze, and de Villiers leaves Bracken to de Villiers, no run again that swung into the right-hander, de Villiers into line and drops into the leg side Bracken to de Villiers, no run a similar line, de Villiers pushes the ball no more than five or six yards into the leg side Bracken to de Villiers, no run outside off and wide enough to leave Bracken to de Villiers, FOUR runs de Villiers pushes forward, a thick edge shoots along the ground to the right of solitary slip and the ball flies across the outfield McGrath to Smith, 1 run Smith whips that from middle-and-leg into the on side, an easy run to the man in the deep McGrath to de Villiers, 1 wide that started wide of off and swung significantly, an easy wide to call and Gilchrist had to scurry across to gather McGrath to de Villiers, no run better line, and less swing, de Villiers leaves it alone McGrath to de Villiers, no run massive shout as de Villiers took a half stride and misses. Aleem Dar shakes his head McGrath to de Villiers, no run outside off and no alarms this time as the batsman leaves it McGrath to de Villiers, no run McGrath finds the edge and it drops just short of Ponting at second slip Bracken to Smith, no run Smith takes a stroll down the pitch before Bracken is even in his delivery stride, prods and misses Bracken to Smith, no run this time Smith stays anchored to the crease and pushes into the covers Bracken to Smith, OUT Smith again walks down the pitch to meet the ball, shapes to hit over the top and a sniff of swing takes the ball past the bat and into the off stump Bracken to Kallis, no run Kallis spars and misses one outside off, much oohing and aahing among players, crowd and Cricinfo staff. 79mph for speed freaks. Bracken to Kallis, no run wider, and Kallis able to watch that pass Bracken to Kallis, no run 82mph, and Kallis plays a slightly hurried defensive jab McGrath to de Villiers, no run wide and left McGrath to de Villiers, no run McGrath continues with his nagging line fractionally outside off - 79mph - and de Villiers not tempted to nibble ... yet McGrath to de Villiers, no run fractionally too wide, and McGrath looks to the heavens as he knows that's not quite the right line McGrath to de Villiers, no run quicker - 83mph - and de Villiers drawn forward and then leaves with a theatrical flourish McGrath to de Villiers, no run pushed defensive shot, a thick inside edge and the ball dribbles into the leg side McGrath to de Villiers, no run on target, de Villiers into line and plays into the leg side Bracken to Kallis, no run punched off the back foot into the covers, and all with one hand as the bottom one slips off the handle as he plays the stroke Bracken to Kallis, no run a strangled appeal as the ball hits Kallis high on the pad ... he had taken two big steps down the pitch Bracken to Kallis, 1 run a rather limp drive between cover fielders, muted cheers and a solitary horn welcome the run to the man in the deep Bracken to de Villiers, no run a grunt from Bracken, and then a delivery wide off off stump which de Villiers leaves Bracken to de Villiers, no run de Villiers back, into line, and blocks into the off Bracken to de Villiers, no run another good over ends with a leave from de Villiers McGrath to Kallis, no run Kallis not remotely tempted as the ball passes by and Gilchrist takes by his feet McGrath to Kallis, FOUR runs Kallis dances down the track, McGrath sees him step to leg, follows him, but Kallis still punches that past extra cover McGrath to Kallis, OUT Kallis again gives himself room and advances to meet the ball, but McGrath fires in a yorker which clatters into the off stump McGrath to Gibbs, no run 84mph from McGrath. Either the old man is fired up or, as has happened a few times, the speed gun is up the creek. Anyhow, outside off and Gibbs watches and leaves McGrath to Gibbs, 1 run half-volley outside off, driven to Hogg at mid-off and they scurry through for a quick single McGrath to de Villiers, FOUR runs McGrath drops short, de Villiers on it in a flash and smashes that past a diving short midwicket. That was really clobbered Bracken to Gibbs, 1 run wide and a slashed drive races to deep backward point Bracken to de Villiers, 1 run pushed to mid-on, Watson picks up and throws at the bowler's end, de Villiers was out had the ball hit. At 18 for 2, that was just daft Bracken to Gibbs, no run left alone Bracken to Gibbs, 1 run Gibbs shapes to flick to leg, gets a thick edge via pad, and the ball plops into the on side Bracken to de Villiers, no run de Villiers happy to leave one a foot outside the off Bracken to de Villiers, 1 run driven firmly to the left of mid-off, and that placement allows for the easy single McGrath to de Villiers, no run McGrath starts his fourth over with a loosener outside off McGrath to de Villiers, no run slightly closer to the off stump but again the batsman not lured into anything McGrath to de Villiers, no run pushed into the off side, pounced on like a fly in a Venus thingytrap McGrath to de Villiers, no run Glichrist takes that as de Villiers ushers it by McGrath to de Villiers, no run stock McGrath delivery, niggly and just outside off McGrath to de Villiers, 1 run de Villiers leaps out of his crease to meet the ball and square drives to the sweeper Tait to de Villiers, FOUR runs Tait opens with a bouncer at 88mph, and it's almost as if de Villiers has been sent advanced notice, he's on it so fast and hammers that over midwicket Tait to de Villiers, no run fired in at almost 93mph and de Villiers blocks off the back foot Tait to de Villiers, no run slower ball - 91.9mph - and de Villiers is almost early on the attempted pull. It did keep low outside off ... Tait to de Villiers, no run short - another 90mph+ delivery - and de Villiers sways back just in case Tait to de Villiers, OUT full, de Villiers drives with no foot movement, and a thick kick carries straight to Gilchrist. A fourth delivery over 90mph, a good mixture of length, and now South Africa are up against it Tait to Prince, no run right back and drops the ball at his feet McGrath to Gibbs, no run McGrath seems almost a spinner after watching Tait ... good line, good length and defended McGrath to Gibbs, no run Gibbs thrusts his pad down the pitch, covering any movement, and then opts to leave McGrath to Gibbs, 1 run McGrath drifts to leg - seriously - and Gibbs turns the ball just in front of square McGrath to Prince, OUT And that might be it ... about the worst ball McGrath has bowled, wide and angled away from the left-hander, but Prince slashes, gets a thin edge, and Gilchrist does the rest McGrath to Boucher, OUT McGrath on a hat-trick ... much better ball, a stock McGrath delivery, Boucher plays a nothing prod and the ball is held low down by Matthew Hayden at first slip McGrath to Kemp, no run oh my goodness ... Kemp leaves and the ball passes knee-shakingly close to his off stump. Good judgment ... but a great over from McGrath. Tait to Gibbs, no run and another! But Bucknor doesn't raise his finger. A fierce inswinger as Gibbs goes right back, inside edges it to Gilchrist who tumbles to his left but...Bucknor refuses to raise his finger Tait to Gibbs, FOUR runs and he crashes this on the front foot but it's just wide of the lone slip - and I reiterate, there's just one slip in there Tait to Gibbs, FOUR runs fabulous shot. The most textbook of cover drives, creaming it on the front foot through extra cover Tait to Gibbs, no run ooh well bowled, Tait, cutting this back into Gibbs who is back into his crease - rather late on it - defending off the back foot Tait to Gibbs, no run shorter this time from Tait, and he grunts in doing so, forcing Gibbs back into his crease and he defends off the back foot Tait to Gibbs, no run very well bowled from Tait, who has so far been far from the scattergun. In fact, he's been sniper-like: a 93.4mph (150ish kph) inswinger which Gibbs is very late on, nudging it to leg McGrath to Kemp, 1 run Short and quick from McGrath McGrath to Gibbs, no run classic McGrath, cutting this back into him and it's defended solidly McGrath to Gibbs, no run right in the channel there, absolutely perfect line just outside off stump and he comes forward, rather tentatively, defending it back to McGrath McGrath to Gibbs, no run and McGrath is in once again, chugging up to the crease and again lands it on a sixpenny and Gibbs is forced to block it out on the front foot McGrath to Gibbs, no run ever so slightly wider from McGrath - the teaser McGrath to Gibbs, no run Gibbs again leaves it alone outside off Tait to Kemp, 1 leg bye Another prehistoric grunt from Tait as he flings this down - but it's a little too straight and worked off his pads Tait to Gibbs, FOUR runs outside off, Gibbs plants his foot and slashes it over the slips - not far off at all Tait to Gibbs, no run ah, very good comeback from Tait just pitching it up a smidgen more Tait to Gibbs, 1 run oh hello, a Tait slower ball. That's new - or at least, I've not seen it much before. Gibbs reads it, though, and on the front foot neatly guides it down to third man with surprising deftness Tait to Kemp, 5 wide oh dear, Tait's replaced his sniper rifle with the greater-spotted potato gun. This is miles down the leg side and Gilchrist doesn't have a chance Tait to Kemp, no run on off stump this time, much better, and it's firmly defended Tait to Kemp, no run cracking ball, at high pace, swinging into the right hander who digs it out at the very last moment. A yorker, in fact Bracken to Gibbs, 1 run and he starts lazily, drifting it down the leg side and Gibbs plucks it with ease to leg Bracken to Kemp, 1 run ooh close! A lovely delivery angling across a very nervous Justin Kemp who, even more nervously, pushes forward without conviction and edges it past the second slip Bracken to Gibbs, no run defended on the front foot Bracken to Gibbs, 1 run ah, delightful shot, coming forward on the front foot and just working it - smudging it - through midwicket Bracken to Kemp, no run gets into a bit of a tangle, Kemp, here. A shorter delivery which rises up on him and he defends, using his chest Watson to Gibbs, FOUR runs what a magnificent shot from Gibbs, a flick behind square which beats the man at deep square leg Watson to Gibbs, no run and Gibbs drives with vast amounts of class here, but straight to cover Watson to Gibbs, no run much better from Watson - that's the length and it's pumped back to the bowler Watson to Gibbs, no run just a little wider this time from Watson and Gibbs is back-and-across, pushing it out to cover Watson to Gibbs, 1 run a Watson slower-ball which is nicely nudged off the front foot down to fine leg Watson to Kemp, no run Kemp is less deft, but he defends with a solid lunge of the front foot and pushes this back to the bowler Hogg to Gibbs, no run quick, on middle-and-leg and it's worked further to leg Hogg to Gibbs, 1 run again on leg stump - quick and flat - turned around the corner Hogg to Kemp, no run well bowled, on middle stump and Kemp comes forward - massively - defending it on the front foot Hogg to Kemp, no run that's more like it from Kemp, hammering it on the front foot and timing it very well but straight to cover Hogg to Kemp, no run what a ball from the tongue-master, a wrong'un which Kemp complete misreads, coming forward, trying to defend, but missing it by a country mile Hogg to Kemp, no run and again he's beaten Watson to Gibbs, FOUR runs poor delivery, short and straight, Gibbs pulling it behind square Watson to Gibbs, no run better Watson to Gibbs, no run good idea from Watson, who increasingly resembles the incredible hulk, bouncing the batsman...but he's pretty settled now, ducking underneath it easily Watson to Gibbs, no run pushed back to the bowler and Gibbs gives him a stare. And why not? Watson to Gibbs, 1 run calmly strokes past short extra cover Watson to Kemp, 1 run on middle-and-off, Kemp lunges forward like a monster and defends Hogg to Kemp, 2 runs poor ball outside leg, deftly paddled around the corner Hogg to Kemp, 1 run very well played again, straighter this time and he plants his foot down the pitch and ladles it around the corner Hogg to Gibbs, 1 run flicked through midwicket Hogg to Kemp, no run blocked out on the front foot Hogg to Kemp, 1 run a full bunger from Hogg, punched through cover - rather takes Kemp by surprise, hence not trying to hit it into the USA Watson to Kemp, no run defended on the front foot Watson to Kemp, no run excellent ball on off stump and he comes forward to defend this out to cover Watson to Kemp, no run ah, now then - that's more like it from Watson. An excellent bouncer which takes the batsman by surprise, as he attempts to pull before deciding to leave it well alone Watson to Kemp, 2 runs Kemp late-cuts this with oodles of time, and class, behind point and wide of third man who sprints to his right to field Watson to Kemp, no run swinging into him, it's defended on the front foot Watson to Kemp, no run another good one just outside off. Watson bowling with excellent control so far and it's blocked out Hogg to Gibbs, 1 run on leg stump, picked off for a single Hogg to Kemp, no run ooh, this one holds up on him - just outside off, spinning back into him and jumping up a touch, it's blocked out Hogg to Kemp, no run full and straight, blocked out Hogg to Kemp, no run and he plays and misses outside off - the arm ball there Hogg to Kemp, 1 run on leg stump - flatter and quicker and defended Hogg to Gibbs, no run beaten! Terrific ball, the wrong'un which he plays at and misses, Hogg's tongue slavers around uncontrollably Watson to Kemp, no run on leg and that's skewed in front of square to the man there Watson to Kemp, no run slower ball, on the money, and that's defended forward Watson to Kemp, no run beautiful delivery that one, nipping back in at the righthander and threatening to kiss the outside edge Watson to Kemp, no run left alone this time Watson to Kemp, SIX runs short and Kemp's on that one so quickly, fending the ball with a hook right off his helmet - top work, that was close to him, and although he didn't get hold of it properlyit sailed away. And that's the fifty partnership Watson to Kemp, no run defended off the back foot into the covers Hogg to Gibbs, 1 run on leg, the batsman comes forward and sweeps that round on the front foot behind square Hogg to Kemp, 1 run swept that round behind square Hogg to Gibbs, no run the one that went the other way - the ball, not his tongue - and that slavers outside off and is left alone easily Hogg to Gibbs, 1 run another ball on leg, another sweep, this one dinked as gentle as the others Hogg to Kemp, 1 run on middle, doesn't read that one, and a tentative prod from Kemp sends an outside edge backward of point Hogg to Gibbs, 1 wide outside leg, chased round, and that's just to say wide Hogg to Gibbs, 1 run on leg and that turns towards leg even more, the batsman just poking that into short square Tait to Gibbs, no run bouncer, straight and high. Tait follows through with a serious look on his face - he means more business here all right Tait to Gibbs, FOUR runs outside off, way too much width and Gibbs just opens his shoulders and swings hard, and that one flies up off the base of the bat behind point, not quite where he intended it, but it fair raced away Tait to Gibbs, no run pushes him back up there to defend into the covers Tait to Gibbs, OUT got him this time! A very, very thin edge - much thinner than the one which wasn't given earlier, also to Tait - looking for the short-pitched delivery. His feet were just rooted in the crease there as he chased the ball away from his body Tait to Hall, no run good pace, right up there and scattering a cloud of dust as Hall edges that low, on the front foot, and unconvincingly down towards the slip region Hogg to Kemp, no run up there again, on middle, and that's defended once more, on the front foot again Hogg to Kemp, no run pitches on middle, moves to off and Kemp's not sure how to play that - he tries to sweep, doesn't really get hold of the ball Hogg to Kemp, no run defended again, Kemp not looking at all comfortable Hogg to Kemp, 1 wide wide down off, Kemp backs away to give himself room to cut, but that one went the other way and he was miles away from it Hogg to Kemp, 1 wide another wide down off. By George! Hogg can't believe that one - not sure why, it was very wide Hogg to Kemp, no run defended this time Hogg to Kemp, no run comes forward and defends that one on the front foot. Not much fuss about that shot Tait to Hall, no run awkward bounce to deal with that one, but Hall stays cool as ever defending down off the back foot Tait to Hall, 1 run gets his yorker line all wrong, and that's worked off the toes out to Mr Hussey-Cricket on the deep square boundary and he does a slide and relay with McGrath Tait to Kemp, no run left alone outside off this time Tait to Kemp, no run better yorker this time, obviously the length was right as before, but this time it was on the toes and that's just defended forward Tait to Kemp, no run bouncer down the channel and Kemp leaves that one alone Tait to Kemp, no run another bouncer, straight, and that's well avoided Hogg to Hall, no run tosses that one up, it dips naughtily at the last minute and the batsman rolls out a tame forward drive Hogg to Hall, 1 run swished off the toes to short midwicket Hogg to Kemp, no run right up there and there's a play and a miss Hogg to Kemp, 1 run some room outside off, the batsman waits and cuts that away into the covers with a mere tuck of a cut Hogg to Hall, 1 run turning away towards off again, this shot isn't so neat, an ugly chop down, yet again into the covers Tait to Nel, OUT short and wide, slashed high to backward point who backpeddled and took an easy catch above his head Tait to Kemp, no run slower ball - if you can describe 81mph as slower - and Langeveldt into line to block Tait to Kemp, no run faster and a bit shorter, Langeveldt sways out of the way. It probably would have missed him anyway Tait to Kemp, no run full, Langeveldt winds up and drives the ball to Hogg at mid-off Tait to Kemp, 1 wide Tait loses his bearings and spears one down the leg side Tait to Kemp, no run full and this time on target, Kemp defends Tait to Kemp, 1 run quite deliberately and safely steered down to third man. Kemp keeps the strike Watson to Kemp, FOUR runs Watson attempts the yorker, doesn't quite get it right and Kemp slams a full toss back over the bowler's head Watson to Kemp, 1 run full, driven almost as hard but there is a long-off in place Watson to Langeveldt, no run Langeveldt heads towards the square-leg umpire and blocks Watson to Langeveldt, 1 run decent ball which Langeveldt swings at, hits, and the ball arcs short of the man out in the deep on the off side Watson to Kemp, FOUR runs another full toss from Watson which Kemp absolutely smears through extra cover Watson to Kemp, no run slower ball but Kemp can't find the single he needs, leaving Langeveldt exposed Tait to Hall, OUT and Tait strikes again! Hall looked to lash that off the back foot through cover, but his feet must have been dipped in the same tub of superglue as Gibbs's as he strikes at the ball away from the body and a thickish edge rips through. Gilchrist makes no mistake Tait to Pollock, no run oh, Pollock was lucky to survive there, this one nipping back in off the seam and Pollock doing his valiant best to give Gilchrist another catching opportunity - but failed to get hold of it Tait to Pollock, no run right up there and that's poked into the covers. A bit of shuffling from Hogg in his sunhat as he takes his time to throw down the stumps. It looked in, and replays quickly confirmed it was Tait to Pollock, 1 run bouncer crashes into Pollock's gloves at just-crouching height - Pollock did well to shield his body there, but he's not looking comfortable Tait to Kemp, no run plays that away from his body, poking it down to gully off the back foot Tait to Kemp, no run more grunting from Tait, and that's up there, defended just outside off and just in front of yorker length Bracken to Pollock, no run he's over the wicket and that's defended forward first up Bracken to Pollock, no run across the righthander again and that's defended into the covers Bracken to Pollock, no run on middle and off, Pollock plays that into the covers in a very defensive manner Bracken to Pollock, no run straight, a touch short, and defended easily enough on the back foot this time Bracken to Pollock, no run outside off, Pollock tries to cut that off the back foot through point, but chops an inside edge down into the ground, safely enough Bracken to Langeveldt, 1 run Langeveldt drops into the leg side and runs. McGrath teapots that the No. 11 was allowed to get off strike first ball Bracken to Kemp, 1 run Kemp sweeps, Bracken appeals thinking it missed the bat, but Bucknor disagrees Bracken to Langeveldt, no run driven into the covers Bracken to Langeveldt, no run punched square on the off side Bracken to Langeveldt, no run Langeveldt misses with a swish to leg, strangled appeal as it again pitched outside the line Bracken to Langeveldt, no run defended into the off side, a quiet over but at least Kemp keeps the strike Watson to Kemp, no run Kemp heaves over midwicket to Hayden in the deep, but they decide not to run Watson to Kemp, 1 run driven straight to Tait at long-on, it went high but right to him. he caught it , dropped it, juggled the rebound before ending up in a big heap with the ball next to him Watson to Langeveldt, no run a big heave and a big miss Watson to Langeveldt, FOUR runs another heave from Langeveldt who is heading towards square leg as he plays it, over point and over the rope Watson to Langeveldt, OUT up in the block hole and Langeveldt, again giving himself room, is in no position to play it and is cleaned up That's South Africa's lowest score in the World Cup and Australia bounce off the field. On TV they are still pretending this game is well and truly alive, but the reality is that it will take something remarkable to prevent Australia reaching the final now. Lubna Kabir reckons you don't need a bar for some places in the States - instead, Indian restaurants frequented by Indian, Sri Lankan, Bangladeshi and Pakistani taxi drivers should do it - in Boston, DC and Philly for sure. A quick note - these suggestions are from readers and we in no way endorse them or vouch for the accuracy of the information. 1.00pm Various readers have answered questions as to where the final will be shown in the USA. NY/NJ -Cafe Spice in Jersey City has been showing all World Cup matches, and Galaxy Cinema, Raleigh, NC is showing all the games, and Eight Mile Creek, an Aussie bar/restaurant on Mulberry St ... and also Ship of Fools on 2nd Ave at 82nd ... Boston - Tommy Doyle's in Harvard Square, 1.25pm That's the public service broadcast over. Hope it helps. We are still not aware of anywhere in Miami and there have been loads of requests from there, so shout if you can help. Welcome back all. It is I, Will, here for another 10 over stint - which ought to be just enough time for Australia to knock off these 150 runs. Well nearly, anyway. I'm just finishing off my Ploughmans (cheddar, for the cheese freaks among you) and we're about five minutes away from starting. Damn smoking police. Anyway, hope our pub crawl information proved useful. If you do For those in Florida Churchill's Pub off 2nd Ave in Miami will show the World Cup...or at least it ought to, suggests Frank, who watched the Ashes from there. Sad news has just come in from Cricinfo's obituary expert, Martin, who tells us Arthur Milton has died. Pollock to open (the bowling. Obviously. He hasn't defected to Australia). Blustery out there which could help him. Let's face it; South Africa need all the assistance they can get Smith's hurt his leg there and immediately threw the ball into the ground. Hayden would never have played that shot had the target been 250 rather than 150. Even he seemed to have enough. Pollock to Clarke, no run slightly short, cut hard to point Pollock to Clarke, no run outside off, Clarke looks to cut again, misses and Boucher whips the bails off Pollock to Clarke, 1 run third time lucky, outside off and this time Clarke finds the space, running the ball down to third man Pollock to Clarke, 1 run Clarke stands tall and smacks the ball off the back foot through extra cover Pollock to Symonds, no run firm drive but no run as he fails to find the gap either side of mid-off Hall to Clarke, no run half volley driven to Smith at mid-on. Smith grimaces as he bends and switches to mid-off hoping the ball doesn't go there Hall to Clarke, no run back to the bowler, much to Smith's relief Hall to Clarke, 1 run driven straight back to the right of Hall, mid-on scampers round to field. had Smith been there, he would never have made it Hall to Symonds, 1 run Symonds back again, this time he flicks it square on the leg to get off the mark Hall to Clarke, FOUR runs Jenny purrs as Clarke eases the ball off his pads between mid-on and midwicket. All so easy, all so predictable Nel to Symonds, FOUR runs horrible long-hop which may have been an attempted bouncer from the snarling Nel, Symonds smacks it dismissively through midwicket. Fetch Nel to Symonds, 1 run carved through the off side, Nel stares and Symonds just trots past him without even giving him the time of day Nel to Clarke, FOUR runs slashed over gully this time Nel to Clarke, no run better ball, on target and blocked Nel to Clarke, no run outside off stump, Clarke leaves it Nel to Clarke, 1 run outside off at 86mph, Clarke hits it into the ground, it dribbles into the off and they run a single Hall to Clarke, 1 run pushed back straight as an arrow, mid-on again has to make a fair amount of ground to his left to field Hall to Symonds, no run Symonds half forward and drives hard to extra cover Hall to Symonds, no run whipped off middle to midwicket Hall to Symonds, no run dropped full and creamed back at Hall's midriff, technically a chance but it was really travelling and at this stage of the game, there's not much point in heroics Hall to Symonds, no run Symonds much more circumspect after the let-off Nel to Clarke, no run driven into the ground and Nel takes at chest height in his follow through Nel to Clarke, no run chipped to mid-on, in the air but Nel would have needed to be Spiderman to have got across to that Nel to Clarke, no run wide and smeared to point where Gibbs makes a good stop diving to his right Nel to Clarke, no run into the ground, Clarke ponders the single but the ball went no more a yard in front of him and Nel was wise to what he was thinking Nel to Clarke, FOUR runs hit on the up, over mid-on and that's his fifty off 75 balls Nel to Clarke, no run checked drive, with a sniff of an inside edge, to mid-on Hall to Symonds, no run straight and Symonds very respectfully blocks Hall to Symonds, no run swished off middle to midwicket where Kallis makes a decent stop even though he overshot once he had got a hand to the ball Hall to Symonds, 2 runs clipped off leg stump to deep backward square leg Hall to Symonds, 1 run Symonds heaves towards midwicket, get a thick edge and the ball scoots down to third man Hall to Clarke, no run pushed to extra cover Hall to Clarke, 1 run Clarke takes a couple of steps and drives to mid-on Langeveldt to Clarke, 2 runs controlled cut to third man Langeveldt to Clarke, no run patted into the covers Langeveldt to Clarke, no run yorker, Clarke digs it out with a little sniff of lateness Langeveldt to Clarke, no run outside off, no contact Langeveldt to Clarke, no run blocked to extra cover Hall to Symonds, 1 run worked through square leg Hall to Clarke, FOUR runs Clarke gives himself room and cracks that back from where it came, with interest Hall to Clarke, (no ball) 1 run driven past extra cover, and a no-ball Hall to Symonds, FOUR runs leg-side full toss, Symonds does the business with a swish through midwicket and that's Australia into their fourth successive final Pollock to Hayden, no run cut to point Pollock to Hayden, 3 runs oh but he's off the mark now. Hayden's had enough of this block-prod-block malarkey, picking up this half volley and dispatching it over midwicket for four. Not pretty, but very Hayden-esque Pollock to Ponting, 1 run that's a terrific line from Pollock, on off stump and Ponting pushes it just past the bowler - immediately Ponting sets off for a run, and gets it, much to Pollock's disgust Pollock to Hayden, no run a squirted, smudged yet purposeful inside edge to mid-on Pollock to Hayden, no run good length just outside off and Hayden is resolute in defence Pollock to Hayden, FOUR runs oh he's definitely had enough now, Hayden. A stroke of brute, ugly power, heaving it through midwicket, flat, for four Kallis to Ponting, no run a touch too wide but a good length, Ponting defends off the back foot back to Kallis Kallis to Ponting, no run too straight from Kallis, on Ponting's middle stump and he flicks his wrists to midwicket, setting off for a single before Hayden sends him back Kallis to Ponting, no run another big stride down the pitch from Ponting, creaming it to cover. He looks in absurd touch Kallis to Ponting, no run good length, just drawing Ponting forward - at good pace, too - and Ponting cracks it on the front foot, opening the face of the bat, to Gibbs at point Kallis to Ponting, no run driven to extra cover Kallis to Ponting, no run a textbook cover drive, but straight to mid-off Nel to Hayden, no run and it's defended off the back foot Nel to Hayden, 1 run banged in short, but it's down the leg side and Hayden works it down to fine-leg. Nel falls over in his follow-through, as he so often does Nel to Ponting, FOUR runs terrible ball, a massive wide which Ponting just leans into, stroking it through cover, bisecting mid-off and cover, and it races for four. Absolutely no chance of stopping that Nel to Ponting, 1 run ooh that's better from Nel, a tighter line which forces Ponting to defend...though it's padded away and they pick up a single Nel to Hayden, 1 run but it's too straight, Nel not able to adjust his line and Hayden clips a single to leg Nel to Ponting, no run driven to mid-off Kallis to Hayden, 1 wide good bounce from Kallis but, oh dear, it's very wide of the off stump and rightly wided by the not-so-wide umpire Kallis to Hayden, no run ooh and a play-and-a-miss outside off - fuller this time from Kallis and Hayden tries to late cut, but the ball kept a touch low Kallis to Hayden, no run crunched on the front foot to cover Kallis to Hayden, no run hammered! My word, he very nearly killed short extra cover. Andrew Hall the fielder there Kallis to Hayden, FOUR runs grief, that is some shot from Hayden. No great foot movement, flicked on the up through mid-on for four. Extraordinary shot in fact Kallis to Hayden, 1 run pushed to mid-off this time and he sets off for a single Kallis to Ponting, no run worked to leg but no single on offer Nel to Hayden, no run defended on the front foot Nel to Hayden, no run just a touch wide, giving Hayden the room to free his arms and he strokes it to cover but Hall does magnificently to prevent the single. Or the two, three or indeed four Nel to Hayden, no run tighter line and a fuller length which Hayden back-cuts to point Nel to Hayden, 3 runs on leg stump, Hayden leans on it and clips it through midwicket. But the man at deep midwicket makes a fumble, allowing them through for two. Hall is not pleased, and the stump mic picks up every word Nel to Ponting, 1 wide wide of the off stump, left alone...but it's a wide Nel to Ponting, no run down on one knee, Ponting carves it to cover Kallis to Hayden, 1 run swinging into Hayden who works it through midwicket Kallis to Clarke, 1 leg bye drifting down Clarke's leg side and he works it off his pads Kallis to Hayden, FOUR runs absolutely magnificent shot. The power...just breathless. Perfectly reasonable ball Kallis to Hayden, no run again monstrously struck but this time straight to mid-off Kallis to Hayden, no run timed off the back foot to extra cover Kallis to Hayden, no run Hayden pulls but, for once, can't get hold of it Nel to Clarke, no run shuffled through, bustling effort, but that's just left alone outside off - Clarke with all the time in the world (cue Louis Armstrong song music) Nel to Clarke, no run more leaving Nel to Clarke, no run a bit of wobble and no dobble as that one nips back in and that's defended forward Nel to Clarke, no run more leaving this time, that one outside off Nel to Clarke, FOUR runs nice shot to get off the mark, leaning into that one outside off on the front foot and Nel's furious with himself Nel to Clarke, no run outside off and that's just defended forward Kallis to Hayden, 2 runs over the wicket, by the way, that's poked into the covers for a quick single and there's a very close shy from ABCdEV... ooh. Overthrows result Kallis to Hayden, 1 run dabbed out off the back foot out to deep point where it's winged back in without much fuss Kallis to Clarke, no run left alone outside off Kallis to Clarke, no run hostile bouncer, Kallis finding some spring there with one which whistles past the grille. Good bouncing, there Kallis to Clarke, no run a tamer one, this just floating down the channel and it's left alone easily Nel to Hayden, 1 run driven straight to long-off Nel to Clarke, no run outside off and Clarke launches into a cover-drive but he doesn't time it very well at all Nel to Clarke, no run left alone outside off Nel to Clarke, no run bustled through down the channel and Clarke leaves it alone again Nel to Clarke, 1 run outside off and Clarke drives that, again without total timing, to the covers Nel to Hayden, no run round the wicket and that's eased into the covers Kallis to Clarke, 1 run just to say strays onto leg and that's tucked into square Kallis to Hayden, 4 leg byes outside leg, that would have been good to a righthander, but he's a lefty, of course, and that's pawed round through fine leg Kallis to Hayden, no run a touch of width outside off, Hayden connects cleanly and cuts that to gully Kallis to Hayden, 1 run quick single to mid-off Kallis to Clarke, 1 run on leg and that's tucked forward with some excellent placement in front of midwicket - Hayden turned down the second Kallis to Hayden, (no ball) 1 run on off and Hayden fails to pull that cleanly in front of square - ah, an overstepped no-ball is signalled - and he rehearses the shot when he makes it to the non-striker's end Kallis to Clarke, 1 run on leg, bounces up and that's tucked into short midwicket Nel to Clarke, no run left alone outside off Nel to Clarke, no run a touch of width outside off and that's cut to point Nel to Clarke, no run outside off, short, and Nel's really pleased with himself, jogging through and laughing like Muttley. Clarke goes to play and then drops his hands at the last minute Nel to Clarke, no run outside off again, driven to the covers and again it's all about waiting on Nel to Clarke, no run on off and that's driven to the covers Nel to Clarke, no run more of the off-side stuff, tidy, and that's defended down Langeveldt to Hayden, 1 run up there, on off, and that's driven back out to mid-on Langeveldt to Clarke, no run outside off, dragged down a touch, and that's poked off the back foot to the covers Langeveldt to Clarke, no run outside off and Clarke shuffles over with his pleasingly straight bat which he presents to the ball Langeveldt to Clarke, 1 run outside off and that's driven out to extra cover Langeveldt to Hayden, no run on off and that's driven to short cover where it's picked up immediately Langeveldt to Hayden, no run over the wicket, incidentally, and that's driven into the covers Hall to Clarke, 2 runs on leg and that's tucked in front of square Hall to Clarke, no run on the money and that's driven to covers Hall to Clarke, FOUR runs on leg and that's a lovely shot from Clarke, timing that off his legs in front of midwicket Hall to Clarke, 1 run outside off, eased through the covers Hall to Hayden, 1 run driven forward and there's a nice little single Hall to Clarke, no run on leg and that's poked to short midwicket Langeveldt to Hayden, no run comes from wide of the wicket, and round too, and that's defended forward Langeveldt to Hayden, no run on the money, on off, and that's defended forward Langeveldt to Hayden, 1 run right up there and that's driven straight Langeveldt to Clarke, 1 run outside and that's thlocked out to the cover boundary with a caress of a nudge off the front foot Langeveldt to Hayden, FOUR runs slower ball monstered through long-off with a two-bounce four - doesn't even hang around to see where the ball went. Nonchalant or what Langeveldt to Hayden, no run straight batted off the back foot to mid-off Hall to Clarke, no run up there and that's defended forward Hall to Clarke, no run straight and played forward Hall to Clarke, no run right up there and that's driven to mid-off Hall to Clarke, 2 runs driven through the covers and that's two more rubbed off the target Hall to Clarke, no run driven into the circle on the leg-side and that's thrown back in Hall to Clarke, FOUR runs outside off and that's driven through cover Langeveldt to Hayden, 1 run driven to wide mid-on Langeveldt to Clarke, no run driven to mid-off Langeveldt to Clarke, no run outside off and driven to cover Langeveldt to Clarke, no run outside off, down on one knee and that's driven to cover Langeveldt to Clarke, FOUR runs slower ball, lovely shot, a languid punch through mid-off Langeveldt to Clarke, 1 run tucked off the hips to square Hall to Clarke, no run straight and blocked, all very correct Hall to Clarke, 1 run driven to mid-on and a quick single, Pollock picks up and hurls the ball right into the ground in front of Boucher, the kind of return that you see regularly in club cricket (well, at Merrow you do) Hall to Hayden, no run hit back hard at Hall, on the half volley and he semi stops before ringing his hand in pain Hall to Hayden, no run blocked to mid-on about twice as hard as most people can drive it, Pollock stops Hall to Hayden, 2 runs yorker which Hayden jams down on, still managing to squeeze the ball into the leg side Hall to Hayden, no run knee-high full toss, hit back to Hall who stick out his right hand and fields Kemp to Clarke, no run very gentle loosener, pushed into the off side Kemp to Clarke, 1 run drifts to leg and Clarke helps it on its way to long leg Kemp to Hayden, no run prodded to mid-off Kemp to Hayden, no run patted to extra cover Kemp to Hayden, no run defended into the off Kemp to Hayden, no run full toss hammered straight at mid-on. You can almost hear the purring in the commercial department at ICC Towers in Dubai Pollock to Clarke, 1 run half volley push-driven to long-on Pollock to Hayden, 1 run to describe this as pedestrian is an insult to pedestrians ... patted to long-off for variety Pollock to Clarke, no run steered off the open face of the bat to point Pollock to Clarke, 1 run driven to long-on Pollock to Hayden, no run slightly shorter, Hayden drops at his feet and looks for a quick single, Clarke decides that would be too exciting and turns it down Pollock to Hayden, 2 runs clipped to deep midwicket where Nel is lurking, both batsmen push for two from the off and make it with ease Kemp to Clarke, 2 runs leg-side half volley, clipped off his toes and Pollock has to chug round from long leg to field Kemp to Clarke, no run well bowled ... a yorker which Clarke dug out late Kemp to Clarke, no run mistimed drive, aimed at mid-off and hit to mid-on Kemp to Clarke, no run flicked to mid-on Kemp to Clarke, no run firm drive back to Kemp, the ball bounces kindly to him at midriff height Kemp to Clarke, 1 run leggish and Clarke sweetly whips that wide of midwicket and mid-on has to scoot round to field Pollock to Clarke, no run slightly short, cut hard to point Pollock to Clarke, no run outside off, Clarke looks to cut again, misses and Boucher whips the bails off Pollock to Clarke, 1 run third time lucky, outside off and this time Clarke finds the space, running the ball down to third man Pollock to Clarke, 1 run Clarke stands tall and smacks the ball off the back foot through extra cover Pollock to Symonds, no run firm drive but no run as he fails to find the gap either side of mid-off Hall to Clarke, no run half volley driven to Smith at mid-on. Smith grimaces as he bends and switches to mid-off hoping the ball doesn't go there Hall to Clarke, no run back to the bowler, much to Smith's relief Hall to Clarke, 1 run driven straight back to the right of Hall, mid-on scampers round to field. had Smith been there, he would never have made it Hall to Symonds, 1 run Symonds back again, this time he flicks it square on the leg to get off the mark Hall to Clarke, FOUR runs Jenny purrs as Clarke eases the ball off his pads between mid-on and midwicket.

The last few hours have been pretty poor for neutrals, dreadful for South Africans, but that's not Australia's fault. They have done the business and will meet Sri Lanka on Saturday in a re-match of the 1996 final. Australia win by seven wickets The South Africans acknowledge the support they have received and then head off to lick their wounds, the Australians amble onto the outfield and start a lap of honour. That's all from Jenny Thompson, Will Luke and Martin Williamson. Many thanks for staying with us through a one-sided match and we will be back, along with Sriram Veera and Jamie Alter, for Saturday's final. It's almost all over ... Australia won by 7 wickets (with 111 balls remaining) Player of the match is Glenn McGrath, AUS\""

            "   am Good morning and welcome to our coverage of the second semi final between Australia and South Africa with the winners taking on Sri Lanka in Saturday s final  Team and toss news to follow any second     Bracken to Smith run uppish and loose pushed drive in the air but into space third man fields Bracken to de Villiers no run wide of off stump plenty of swing aided by a stiff breeze and de Villiers leaves Bracken to de Villiers no run again that swung into the right hander de Villiers into line and drops into the leg side Bracken to de Villiers no run a similar line de Villiers pushes the ball no more than five or six yards into the leg side Bracken to de Villiers no run outside off and wide enough to leave Bracken to de Villiers FOUR runs de Villiers pushes forward a thick edge shoots along the ground to the right of solitary slip and the ball flies across the outfield McGrath to Smith run Smith whips that from middle and leg into the on side an easy run to the man in the deep McGrath to de Villiers wide that started wide of off and swung significantly an easy wide to call and Gilchrist had to scurry across to gather McGrath to de Villiers no run better line and less swing de Villiers leaves it alone McGrath to de Villiers no run massive shout as de Villiers took a half stride and misses  Aleem Dar shakes his head McGrath to de Villiers no run outside off and no alarms this time as the batsman leaves it McGrath to de Villiers no run McGrath finds the edge and it drops just short of Ponting at second slip Bracken to Smith no run Smith takes a stroll down the pitch before Bracken is even in his delivery stride prods and misses Bracken to Smith no run this time Smith stays anchored to the crease and pushes into the covers Bracken to Smith OUT Smith again walks down the pitch to meet the ball shapes to hit over the top and a sniff of swing takes the ball past the bat and into the off stump Bracken to Kallis no run Kallis spars and misses one outside off much oohing and aahing among players crowd and Cricinfo staff  mph for speed freaks  Bracken to Kallis no run wider and Kallis able to watch that pass Bracken to Kallis no run mph and Kallis plays a slightly hurried defensive jab McGrath to de Villiers no run wide and left McGrath to de Villiers no run McGrath continues with his nagging line fractionally outside off mph and de Villiers not tempted to nibble     yet McGrath to de Villiers no run fractionally too wide and McGrath looks to the heavens as he knows that s not quite the right line McGrath to de Villiers no run quicker mph and de Villiers drawn forward and then leaves with a theatrical flourish McGrath to de Villiers no run pushed defensive shot a thick inside edge and the ball dribbles into the leg side McGrath to de Villiers no run on target de Villiers into line and plays into the leg side Bracken to Kallis no run punched off the back foot into the covers and all with one hand as the bottom one slips off the handle as he plays the stroke Bracken to Kallis no run a strangled appeal as the ball hits Kallis high on the pad     he had taken two big steps down the pitch Bracken to Kallis run a rather limp drive between cover fielders muted cheers and a solitary horn welcome the run to the man in the deep Bracken to de Villiers no run a grunt from Bracken and then a delivery wide off off stump which de Villiers leaves Bracken to de Villiers no run de Villiers back into line and blocks into the off Bracken to de Villiers no run another good over ends with a leave from de Villiers McGrath to Kallis no run Kallis not remotely tempted as the ball passes by and Gilchrist takes by his feet McGrath to Kallis FOUR runs Kallis dances down the track McGrath sees him step to leg follows him but Kallis still punches that past extra cover McGrath to Kallis OUT Kallis again gives himself room and advances to meet the ball but McGrath fires in a yorker which clatters into the off stump McGrath to Gibbs no run mph from McGrath  Either the old man is fired up or as has happened a few times the speed gun is up the creek  Anyhow outside off and Gibbs watches and leaves McGrath to Gibbs run half volley outside off driven to Hogg at mid off and they scurry through for a quick single McGrath to de Villiers FOUR runs McGrath drops short de Villiers on it in a flash and smashes that past a diving short midwicket  That was really clobbered Bracken to Gibbs run wide and a slashed drive races to deep backward point Bracken to de Villiers run pushed to mid on Watson picks up and throws at the bowler s end de Villiers was out had the ball hit  At for that was just daft Bracken to Gibbs no run left alone Bracken to Gibbs run Gibbs shapes to flick to leg gets a thick edge via pad and the ball plops into the on side Bracken to de Villiers no run de Villiers happy to leave one a foot outside the off Bracken to de Villiers run driven firmly to the left of mid off and that placement allows for the easy single McGrath to de Villiers no run McGrath starts his fourth over with a loosener outside off McGrath to de Villiers no run slightly closer to the off stump but again the batsman not lured into anything McGrath to de Villiers no run pushed into the off side pounced on like a fly in a Venus thingytrap McGrath to de Villiers no run Glichrist takes that as de Villiers ushers it by McGrath to de Villiers no run stock McGrath delivery niggly and just outside off McGrath to de Villiers run de Villiers leaps out of his crease to meet the ball and square drives to the sweeper Tait to de Villiers FOUR runs Tait opens with a bouncer at mph and it s almost as if de Villiers has been sent advanced notice he s on it so fast and hammers that over midwicket Tait to de Villiers no run fired in at almost mph and de Villiers blocks off the back foot Tait to de Villiers no run slower ball   mph and de Villiers is almost early on the attempted pull  It did keep low outside off     Tait to de Villiers no run short another mph delivery and de Villiers sways back just in case Tait to de Villiers OUT full de Villiers drives with no foot movement and a thick kick carries straight to Gilchrist  A fourth delivery over mph a good mixture of length and now South Africa are up against it Tait to Prince no run right back and drops the ball at his feet McGrath to Gibbs no run McGrath seems almost a spinner after watching Tait     good line good length and defended McGrath to Gibbs no run Gibbs thrusts his pad down the pitch covering any movement and then opts to leave McGrath to Gibbs run McGrath drifts to leg seriously and Gibbs turns the ball just in front of square McGrath to Prince OUT And that might be it     about the worst ball McGrath has bowled wide and angled away from the left hander but Prince slashes gets a thin edge and Gilchrist does the rest McGrath to Boucher OUT McGrath on a hat trick     much better ball a stock McGrath delivery Boucher plays a nothing prod and the ball is held low down by Matthew Hayden at first slip McGrath to Kemp no run oh my goodness     Kemp leaves and the ball passes knee shakingly close to his off stump  Good judgment     but a great over from McGrath  Tait to Gibbs no run and another But Bucknor doesn t raise his finger  A fierce inswinger as Gibbs goes right back inside edges it to Gilchrist who tumbles to his left but   Bucknor refuses to raise his finger Tait to Gibbs FOUR runs and he crashes this on the front foot but it s just wide of the lone slip and I reiterate there s just one slip in there Tait to Gibbs FOUR runs fabulous shot  The most textbook of cover drives creaming it on the front foot through extra cover Tait to Gibbs no run ooh well bowled Tait cutting this back into Gibbs who is back into his crease rather late on it defending off the back foot Tait to Gibbs no run shorter this time from Tait and he grunts in doing so forcing Gibbs back into his crease and he defends off the back foot Tait to Gibbs no run very well bowled from Tait who has so far been far from the scattergun  In fact he s been sniper like a   mph ish kph inswinger which Gibbs is very late on nudging it to leg McGrath to Kemp run Short and quick from McGrath McGrath to Gibbs no run classic McGrath cutting this back into him and it s defended solidly McGrath to Gibbs no run right in the channel there absolutely perfect line just outside off stump and he comes forward rather tentatively defending it back to McGrath McGrath to Gibbs no run and McGrath is in once again chugging up to the crease and again lands it on a sixpenny and Gibbs is forced to block it out on the front foot McGrath to Gibbs no run ever so slightly wider from McGrath the teaser McGrath to Gibbs no run Gibbs again leaves it alone outside off Tait to Kemp leg bye Another prehistoric grunt from Tait as he flings this down but it s a little too straight and worked off his pads Tait to Gibbs FOUR runs outside off Gibbs plants his foot and slashes it over the slips not far off at all Tait to Gibbs no run ah very good comeback from Tait just pitching it up a smidgen more Tait to Gibbs run oh hello a Tait slower ball  That s new or at least I ve not seen it much before  Gibbs reads it though and on the front foot neatly guides it down to third man with surprising deftness Tait to Kemp wide oh dear Tait s replaced his sniper rifle with the greater spotted potato gun  This is miles down the leg side and Gilchrist doesn t have a chance Tait to Kemp no run on off stump this time much better and it s firmly defended Tait to Kemp no run cracking ball at high pace swinging into the right hander who digs it out at the very last moment  A yorker in fact Bracken to Gibbs run and he starts lazily drifting it down the leg side and Gibbs plucks it with ease to leg Bracken to Kemp run ooh close A lovely delivery angling across a very nervous Justin Kemp who even more nervously pushes forward without conviction and edges it past the second slip Bracken to Gibbs no run defended on the front foot Bracken to Gibbs run ah delightful shot coming forward on the front foot and just working it smudging it through midwicket Bracken to Kemp no run gets into a bit of a tangle Kemp here  A shorter delivery which rises up on him and he defends using his chest Watson to Gibbs FOUR runs what a magnificent shot from Gibbs a flick behind square which beats the man at deep square leg Watson to Gibbs no run and Gibbs drives with vast amounts of class here but straight to cover Watson to Gibbs no run much better from Watson that s the length and it s pumped back to the bowler Watson to Gibbs no run just a little wider this time from Watson and Gibbs is back and across pushing it out to cover Watson to Gibbs run a Watson slower ball which is nicely nudged off the front foot down to fine leg Watson to Kemp no run Kemp is less deft but he defends with a solid lunge of the front foot and pushes this back to the bowler Hogg to Gibbs no run quick on middle and leg and it s worked further to leg Hogg to Gibbs run again on leg stump quick and flat turned around the corner Hogg to Kemp no run well bowled on middle stump and Kemp comes forward massively defending it on the front foot Hogg to Kemp no run that s more like it from Kemp hammering it on the front foot and timing it very well but straight to cover Hogg to Kemp no run what a ball from the tongue master a wrong un which Kemp complete misreads coming forward trying to defend but missing it by a country mile Hogg to Kemp no run and again he s beaten Watson to Gibbs FOUR runs poor delivery short and straight Gibbs pulling it behind square Watson to Gibbs no run better Watson to Gibbs no run good idea from Watson who increasingly resembles the incredible hulk bouncing the batsman   but he s pretty settled now ducking underneath it easily Watson to Gibbs no run pushed back to the bowler and Gibbs gives him a stare  And why not Watson to Gibbs run calmly strokes past short extra cover Watson to Kemp run on middle and off Kemp lunges forward like a monster and defends Hogg to Kemp runs poor ball outside leg deftly paddled around the corner Hogg to Kemp run very well played again straighter this time and he plants his foot down the pitch and ladles it around the corner Hogg to Gibbs run flicked through midwicket Hogg to Kemp no run blocked out on the front foot Hogg to Kemp run a full bunger from Hogg punched through cover rather takes Kemp by surprise hence not trying to hit it into the USA Watson to Kemp no run defended on the front foot Watson to Kemp no run excellent ball on off stump and he comes forward to defend this out to cover Watson to Kemp no run ah now then that s more like it from Watson  An excellent bouncer which takes the batsman by surprise as he attempts to pull before deciding to leave it well alone Watson to Kemp runs Kemp late cuts this with oodles of time and class behind point and wide of third man who sprints to his right to field Watson to Kemp no run swinging into him it s defended on the front foot Watson to Kemp no run another good one just outside off  Watson bowling with excellent control so far and it s blocked out Hogg to Gibbs run on leg stump picked off for a single Hogg to Kemp no run ooh this one holds up on him just outside off spinning back into him and jumping up a touch it s blocked out Hogg to Kemp no run full and straight blocked out Hogg to Kemp no run and he plays and misses outside off the arm ball there Hogg to Kemp run on leg stump flatter and quicker and defended Hogg to Gibbs no run beaten Terrific ball the wrong un which he plays at and misses Hogg s tongue slavers around uncontrollably Watson to Kemp no run on leg and that s skewed in front of square to the man there Watson to Kemp no run slower ball on the money and that s defended forward Watson to Kemp no run beautiful delivery that one nipping back in at the righthander and threatening to kiss the outside edge Watson to Kemp no run left alone this time Watson to Kemp SIX runs short and Kemp s on that one so quickly fending the ball with a hook right off his helmet top work that was close to him and although he didn t get hold of it properlyit sailed away  And that s the fifty partnership Watson to Kemp no run defended off the back foot into the covers Hogg to Gibbs run on leg the batsman comes forward and sweeps that round on the front foot behind square Hogg to Kemp run swept that round behind square Hogg to Gibbs no run the one that went the other way the ball not his tongue and that slavers outside off and is left alone easily Hogg to Gibbs run another ball on leg another sweep this one dinked as gentle as the others Hogg to Kemp run on middle doesn t read that one and a tentative prod from Kemp sends an outside edge backward of point Hogg to Gibbs wide outside leg chased round and that s just to say wide Hogg to Gibbs run on leg and that turns towards leg even more the batsman just poking that into short square Tait to Gibbs no run bouncer straight and high  Tait follows through with a serious look on his face he means more business here all right Tait to Gibbs FOUR runs outside off way too much width and Gibbs just opens his shoulders and swings hard and that one flies up off the base of the bat behind point not quite where he intended it but it fair raced away Tait to Gibbs no run pushes him back up there to defend into the covers Tait to Gibbs OUT got him this time A very very thin edge much thinner than the one which wasn t given earlier also to Tait looking for the short pitched delivery  His feet were just rooted in the crease there as he chased the ball away from his body Tait to Hall no run good pace right up there and scattering a cloud of dust as Hall edges that low on the front foot and unconvincingly down towards the slip region Hogg to Kemp no run up there again on middle and that s defended once more on the front foot again Hogg to Kemp no run pitches on middle moves to off and Kemp s not sure how to play that he tries to sweep doesn t really get hold of the ball Hogg to Kemp no run defended again Kemp not looking at all comfortable Hogg to Kemp wide wide down off Kemp backs away to give himself room to cut but that one went the other way and he was miles away from it Hogg to Kemp wide another wide down off  By George Hogg can t believe that one not sure why it was very wide Hogg to Kemp no run defended this time Hogg to Kemp no run comes forward and defends that one on the front foot  Not much fuss about that shot Tait to Hall no run awkward bounce to deal with that one but Hall stays cool as ever defending down off the back foot Tait to Hall run gets his yorker line all wrong and that s worked off the toes out to Mr Hussey Cricket on the deep square boundary and he does a slide and relay with McGrath Tait to Kemp no run left alone outside off this time Tait to Kemp no run better yorker this time obviously the length was right as before but this time it was on the toes and that s just defended forward Tait to Kemp no run bouncer down the channel and Kemp leaves that one alone Tait to Kemp no run another bouncer straight and that s well avoided Hogg to Hall no run tosses that one up it dips naughtily at the last minute and the batsman rolls out a tame forward drive Hogg to Hall run swished off the toes to short midwicket Hogg to Kemp no run right up there and there s a play and a miss Hogg to Kemp run some room outside off the batsman waits and cuts that away into the covers with a mere tuck of a cut Hogg to Hall run turning away towards off again this shot isn t so neat an ugly chop down yet again into the covers Tait to Nel OUT short and wide slashed high to backward point who backpeddled and took an easy catch above his head Tait to Kemp no run slower ball if you can describe mph as slower and Langeveldt into line to block Tait to Kemp no run faster and a bit shorter Langeveldt sways out of the way  It probably would have missed him anyway Tait to Kemp no run full Langeveldt winds up and drives the ball to Hogg at mid off Tait to Kemp wide Tait loses his bearings and spears one down the leg side Tait to Kemp no run full and this time on target Kemp defends Tait to Kemp run quite deliberately and safely steered down to third man  Kemp keeps the strike Watson to Kemp FOUR runs Watson attempts the yorker doesn t quite get it right and Kemp slams a full toss back over the bowler s head Watson to Kemp run full driven almost as hard but there is a long off in place Watson to Langeveldt no run Langeveldt heads towards the square leg umpire and blocks Watson to Langeveldt run decent ball which Langeveldt swings at hits and the ball arcs short of the man out in the deep on the off side Watson to Kemp FOUR runs another full toss from Watson which Kemp absolutely smears through extra cover Watson to Kemp no run slower ball but Kemp can t find the single he needs leaving Langeveldt exposed Tait to Hall OUT and Tait strikes again Hall looked to lash that off the back foot through cover but his feet must have been dipped in the same tub of superglue as Gibbs s as he strikes at the ball away from the body and a thickish edge rips through  Gilchrist makes no mistake Tait to Pollock no run oh Pollock was lucky to survive there this one nipping back in off the seam and Pollock doing his valiant best to give Gilchrist another catching opportunity but failed to get hold of it Tait to Pollock no run right up there and that s poked into the covers  A bit of shuffling from Hogg in his sunhat as he takes his time to throw down the stumps  It looked in and replays quickly confirmed it was Tait to Pollock run bouncer crashes into Pollock s gloves at just crouching height Pollock did well to shield his body there but he s not looking comfortable Tait to Kemp no run plays that away from his body poking it down to gully off the back foot Tait to Kemp no run more grunting from Tait and that s up there defended just outside off and just in front of yorker length Bracken to Pollock no run he s over the wicket and that s defended forward first up Bracken to Pollock no run across the righthander again and that s defended into the covers Bracken to Pollock no run on middle and off Pollock plays that into the covers in a very defensive manner Bracken to Pollock no run straight a touch short and defended easily enough on the back foot this time Bracken to Pollock no run outside off Pollock tries to cut that off the back foot through point but chops an inside edge down into the ground safely enough Bracken to Langeveldt run Langeveldt drops into the leg side and runs  McGrath teapots that the No  was allowed to get off strike first ball Bracken to Kemp run Kemp sweeps Bracken appeals thinking it missed the bat but Bucknor disagrees Bracken to Langeveldt no run driven into the covers Bracken to Langeveldt no run punched square on the off side Bracken to Langeveldt no run Langeveldt misses with a swish to leg strangled appeal as it again pitched outside the line Bracken to Langeveldt no run defended into the off side a quiet over but at least Kemp keeps the strike Watson to Kemp no run Kemp heaves over midwicket to Hayden in the deep but they decide not to run Watson to Kemp run driven straight to Tait at long on it went high but right to him  he caught it dropped it juggled the rebound before ending up in a big heap with the ball next to him Watson to Langeveldt no run a big heave and a big miss Watson to Langeveldt FOUR runs another heave from Langeveldt who is heading towards square leg as he plays it over point and over the rope Watson to Langeveldt OUT up in the block hole and Langeveldt again giving himself room is in no position to play it and is cleaned up Bracken to Smith run uppish and loose pushed drive in the air but into space third man fields Bracken to de Villiers no run wide of off stump plenty of swing aided by a stiff breeze and de Villiers leaves Bracken to de Villiers no run again that swung into the right hander de Villiers into line and drops into the leg side Bracken to de Villiers no run a similar line de Villiers pushes the ball no more than five or six yards into the leg side Bracken to de Villiers no run outside off and wide enough to leave Bracken to de Villiers FOUR runs de

Boucher plays a nothing prod and the ball is held low down by Matthew Hayden at first slip McGrath to Kemp no run oh my goodness     Kemp leaves and the ball passes knee shakingly close to his off stump  Good judgment     but a great over from McGrath  Tait to Gibbs no run and another But Bucknor doesn t raise his finger  A fierce inswinger as Gibbs goes right back inside edges it to Gilchrist who tumbles to his left but   Bucknor refuses to raise his finger Tait to Gibbs FOUR runs and he crashes this on the front foot but it s just wide of the lone slip and I reiterate there s just one slip in there Tait to Gibbs FOUR runs fabulous shot  The most textbook of cover drives creaming it on the front foot through extra cover Tait to Gibbs no run ooh well bowled Tait cutting this back into Gibbs who is back into his crease rather late on it defending off the back foot Tait to Gibbs no run shorter this time from Tait and he grunts in doing so forcing Gibbs back into his crease and he defends off the back foot Tait to Gibbs no run very well bowled from Tait who has so far been far from the scattergun  In fact he s been sniper like a   mph ish kph inswinger which Gibbs is very late on nudging it to leg McGrath to Kemp run Short and quick from McGrath McGrath to Gibbs no run classic McGrath cutting this back into him and it s defended solidly McGrath to Gibbs no run right in the channel there absolutely perfect line just outside off stump and he comes forward rather tentatively defending it back to McGrath McGrath to Gibbs no run and McGrath is in once again chugging up to the crease and again lands it on a sixpenny and Gibbs is forced to block it out on the front foot McGrath to Gibbs no run ever so slightly wider from McGrath the teaser McGrath to Gibbs no run Gibbs again leaves it alone outside off Tait to Kemp leg bye Another prehistoric grunt from Tait as he flings this down but it s a little too straight and worked off his pads Tait to Gibbs FOUR runs outside off Gibbs plants his foot and slashes it over the slips not far off at all Tait to Gibbs no run ah very good comeback from Tait just pitching it up a smidgen more Tait to Gibbs run oh hello a Tait slower ball  That s new or at least I ve not seen it much before  Gibbs reads it though and on the front foot neatly guides it down to third man with surprising deftness Tait to Kemp wide oh dear Tait s replaced his sniper rifle with the greater spotted potato gun  This is miles down the leg side and Gilchrist doesn t have a chance Tait to Kemp no run on off stump this time much better and it s firmly defended Tait to Kemp no run cracking ball at high pace swinging into the right hander who digs it out at the very last moment  A yorker in fact Bracken to Gibbs run and he starts lazily drifting it down the leg side and Gibbs plucks it with ease to leg Bracken to Kemp run ooh close A lovely delivery angling across a very nervous Justin Kemp who even more nervously pushes forward without conviction and edges it past the second slip Bracken to Gibbs no run defended on the front foot Bracken to Gibbs run ah delightful shot coming forward on the front foot and just working it smudging it through midwicket Bracken to Kemp no run gets into a bit of a tangle Kemp here  A shorter delivery which rises up on him and he defends using his chest Watson to Gibbs FOUR runs what a magnificent shot from Gibbs a flick behind square which beats the man at deep square leg Watson to Gibbs no run and Gibbs drives with vast amounts of class here but straight to cover Watson to Gibbs no run much better from Watson that s the length and it s pumped back to the bowler Watson to Gibbs no run just a little wider this time from Watson and Gibbs is back and across pushing it out to cover Watson to Gibbs run a Watson slower ball which is nicely nudged off the front foot down to fine leg Watson to Kemp no run Kemp is less deft but he defends with a solid lunge of the front foot and pushes this back to the bowler Hogg to Gibbs no run quick on middle and leg and it s worked further to leg Hogg to Gibbs run again on leg stump quick and flat turned around the corner Hogg to Kemp no run well bowled on middle stump and Kemp comes forward massively defending it on the front foot Hogg to Kemp no run that s more like it from Kemp hammering it on the front foot and timing it very well but straight to cover Hogg to Kemp no run what a ball from the tongue master a wrong un which Kemp complete misreads coming forward trying to defend but missing it by a country mile Hogg to Kemp no run and again he s beaten Watson to Gibbs FOUR runs poor delivery short and straight Gibbs pulling it behind square Watson to Gibbs no run better Watson to Gibbs no run good idea from Watson who increasingly resembles the incredible hulk bouncing the batsman   but he s pretty settled now ducking underneath it easily Watson to Gibbs no run pushed back to the bowler and Gibbs gives him a stare  And why not Watson to Gibbs run calmly strokes past short extra cover Watson to Kemp run on middle and off Kemp lunges forward like a monster and defends Hogg to Kemp runs poor ball outside leg deftly paddled around the corner Hogg to Kemp run very well played again straighter this time and he plants his foot down the pitch and ladles it around the corner Hogg to Gibbs run flicked through midwicket Hogg to Kemp no run blocked out on the front foot Hogg to Kemp run a full bunger from Hogg punched through cover rather takes Kemp by surprise hence not trying to hit it into the USA Watson to Kemp no run defended on the front foot Watson to Kemp no run excellent ball on off stump and he comes forward to defend this out to cover Watson to Kemp no run ah now then that s more like it from Watson  An excellent bouncer which takes the batsman by surprise as he attempts to pull before deciding to leave it well alone Watson to Kemp runs Kemp late cuts this with oodles of time and class behind point and wide of third man who sprints to his right to field Watson to Kemp no run swinging into him it s defended on the front foot Watson to Kemp no run another good one just outside off  Watson bowling with excellent control so far and it s blocked out Hogg to Gibbs run on leg stump picked off for a single Hogg to Kemp no run ooh this one holds up on him just outside off spinning back into him and jumping up a touch it s blocked out Hogg to Kemp no run full and straight blocked out Hogg to Kemp no run and he plays and misses outside off the arm ball there Hogg to Kemp run on leg stump flatter and quicker and defended Hogg to Gibbs no run beaten Terrific ball the wrong un which he plays at and misses Hogg s tongue slavers around uncontrollably Watson to Kemp no run on leg and that s skewed in front of square to the man there Watson to Kemp no run slower ball on the money and that s defended forward Watson to Kemp no run beautiful delivery that one nipping back in at the righthander and threatening to kiss the outside edge Watson to Kemp no run left alone this time Watson to Kemp SIX runs short and Kemp s on that one so quickly fending the ball with a hook right off his helmet top work that was close to him and although he didn t get hold of it properlyit sailed away  And that s the fifty partnership Watson to Kemp no run defended off the back foot into the covers Hogg to Gibbs run on leg the batsman comes forward and sweeps that round on the front foot behind square Hogg to Kemp run swept that round behind square Hogg to Gibbs no run the one that went the other way the ball not his tongue and that slavers outside off and is left alone easily Hogg to Gibbs run another ball on leg another sweep this one dinked as gentle as the others Hogg to Kemp run on middle doesn t read that one and a tentative prod from Kemp sends an outside edge backward of point Hogg to Gibbs wide outside leg chased round and that s just to say wide Hogg to Gibbs run on leg and that turns towards leg even more the batsman just poking that into short square Tait to Gibbs no run bouncer straight and high  Tait follows through with a serious look on his face he means more business here all right Tait to Gibbs FOUR runs outside off way too much width and Gibbs just opens his shoulders and swings hard and that one flies up off the base of the bat behind point not quite where he intended it but it fair raced away Tait to Gibbs no run pushes him back up there to defend into the covers Tait to Gibbs OUT got him this time A very very thin edge much thinner than the one which wasn t given earlier also to Tait looking for the short pitched delivery  His feet were just rooted in the crease there as he chased the ball away from his body Tait to Hall no run good pace right up there and scattering a cloud of dust as Hall edges that low on the front foot and unconvincingly down towards the slip region Hogg to Kemp no run up there again on middle and that s defended once more on the front foot again Hogg to Kemp no run pitches on middle moves to off and Kemp s not sure how to play that he tries to sweep doesn t really get hold of the ball Hogg to Kemp no run defended again Kemp not looking at all comfortable Hogg to Kemp wide wide down off Kemp backs away to give himself room to cut but that one went the other way and he was miles away from it Hogg to Kemp wide another wide down off  By George Hogg can t believe that one not sure why it was very wide Hogg to Kemp no run defended this time Hogg to Kemp no run comes forward and defends that one on the front foot  Not much fuss about that shot Tait to Hall no run awkward bounce to deal with that one but Hall stays cool as ever defending down off the back foot Tait to Hall run gets his yorker line all wrong and that s worked off the toes out to Mr Hussey Cricket on the deep square boundary and he does a slide and relay with McGrath Tait to Kemp no run left alone outside off this time Tait to Kemp no run better yorker this time obviously the length was right as before but this time it was on the toes and that s just defended forward Tait to Kemp no run bouncer down the channel and Kemp leaves that one alone Tait to Kemp no run another bouncer straight and that s well avoided Hogg to Hall no run tosses that one up it dips naughtily at the last minute and the batsman rolls out a tame forward drive Hogg to Hall run swished off the toes to short midwicket Hogg to Kemp no run right up there and there s a play and a miss Hogg to Kemp run some room outside off the batsman waits and cuts that away into the covers with a mere tuck of a cut Hogg to Hall run turning away towards off again this shot isn t so neat an ugly chop down yet again into the covers Tait to Nel OUT short and wide slashed high to backward point who backpeddled and took an easy catch above his head Tait to Kemp no run slower ball if you can describe mph as slower and Langeveldt into line to block Tait to Kemp no run faster and a bit shorter Langeveldt sways out of the way  It probably would have missed him anyway Tait to Kemp no run full Langeveldt winds up and drives the ball to Hogg at mid off Tait to Kemp wide Tait loses his bearings and spears one down the leg side Tait to Kemp no run full and this time on target Kemp defends Tait to Kemp run quite deliberately and safely steered down to third man  Kemp keeps the strike Watson to Kemp FOUR runs Watson attempts the yorker doesn t quite get it right and Kemp slams a full toss back over the bowler s head Watson to Kemp run full driven almost as hard but there is a long off in place Watson to Langeveldt no run Langeveldt heads towards the square leg umpire and blocks Watson to Langeveldt run decent ball which Langeveldt swings at hits and the ball arcs short of the man out in the deep on the off side Watson to Kemp FOUR runs another full toss from Watson which Kemp absolutely smears through extra cover Watson to Kemp no run slower ball but Kemp can t find the single he needs leaving Langeveldt exposed Tait to Hall OUT and Tait strikes again Hall looked to lash that off the back foot through cover but his feet must have been dipped in the same tub of superglue as Gibbs s as he strikes at the ball away from the body and a thickish edge rips through  Gilchrist makes no mistake Tait to Pollock no run oh Pollock was lucky to survive there this one nipping back in off the seam and Pollock doing his valiant best to give Gilchrist another catching opportunity but failed to get hold of it Tait to Pollock no run right up there and that s poked into the covers  A bit of shuffling from Hogg in his sunhat as he takes his time to throw down the stumps  It looked in and replays quickly confirmed it was Tait to Pollock run bouncer crashes into Pollock s gloves at just crouching height Pollock did well to shield his body there but he s not looking comfortable Tait to Kemp no run plays that away from his body poking it down to gully off the back foot Tait to Kemp no run more grunting from Tait and that s up there defended just outside off and just in front of yorker length Bracken to Pollock no run he s over the wicket and that s defended forward first up Bracken to Pollock no run across the righthander again and that s defended into the covers Bracken to Pollock no run on middle and off Pollock plays that into the covers in a very defensive manner Bracken to Pollock no run straight a touch short and defended easily enough on the back foot this time Bracken to Pollock no run outside off Pollock tries to cut that off the back foot through point but chops an inside edge down into the ground safely enough Bracken to Langeveldt run Langeveldt drops into the leg side and runs  McGrath teapots that the No  was allowed to get off strike first ball Bracken to Kemp run Kemp sweeps Bracken appeals thinking it missed the bat but Bucknor disagrees Bracken to Langeveldt no run driven into the covers Bracken to Langeveldt no run punched square on the off side Bracken to Langeveldt no run Langeveldt misses with a swish to leg strangled appeal as it again pitched outside the line Bracken to Langeveldt no run defended into the off side a quiet over but at least Kemp keeps the strike Watson to Kemp no run Kemp heaves over midwicket to Hayden in the deep but they decide not to run Watson to Kemp run driven straight to Tait at long on it went high but right to him  he caught it dropped it juggled the rebound before ending up in a big heap with the ball next to him Watson to Langeveldt no run a big heave and a big miss Watson to Langeveldt FOUR runs another heave from Langeveldt who is heading towards square leg as he plays it over point and over the rope Watson to Langeveldt OUT up in the block hole and Langeveldt again giving himself room is in no position to play it and is cleaned up That s South Africa s lowest score in the World Cup and Australia bounce off the field  On TV they are still pretending this game is well and truly alive but the reality is that it will take something remarkable to prevent Australia reaching the final now  Lubna Kabir reckons you don t need a bar for some places in the States

Martin who tells us Arthur Milton has died  Pollock to open the bowling  Obviously  He hasn t defected to Australia   Blustery out there which could help him  Let s face it South Africa need all the assistance they can get Smith s hurt his leg there and immediately threw the ball into the ground  Hayden would never have played that shot had the target been rather than   Even he seemed to have enough  Pollock to Clarke no run slightly short cut hard to point Pollock to Clarke no run outside off Clarke looks to cut again misses and Boucher whips the bails off Pollock to Clarke run third time lucky outside off and this time Clarke finds the space running the ball down to third man Pollock to Clarke run Clarke stands tall and smacks the ball off the back foot through extra cover Pollock to Symonds no run firm drive but no run as he fails to find the gap either side of mid off Hall to Clarke no run half volley driven to Smith at mid on  Smith grimaces as he bends and switches to mid off hoping the ball doesn t go there Hall to Clarke no run back to the bowler much to Smith s relief Hall to Clarke run driven straight back to the right of Hall mid on scampers round to field  had Smith been there he would never have made it Hall to Symonds run Symonds back again this time he flicks it square on the leg to get off the mark Hall to Clarke FOUR runs Jenny purrs as Clarke eases the ball off his pads between mid on and midwicket  All so easy all so predictable Nel to Symonds FOUR runs horrible long hop which may have been an attempted bouncer from the snarling Nel Symonds smacks it dismissively through midwicket  Fetch Nel to Symonds run carved through the off side Nel stares and Symonds just trots past him without even giving him the time of day Nel to Clarke FOUR runs slashed over gully this time Nel to Clarke no run better ball on target and blocked Nel to Clarke no run outside off stump Clarke leaves it Nel to Clarke run outside off at mph Clarke hits it into the ground it dribbles into the off and they run a single Hall to Clarke run pushed back straight as an arrow mid on again has to make a fair amount of ground to his left to field Hall to Symonds no run Symonds half forward and drives hard to extra cover Hall to Symonds no run whipped off middle to midwicket Hall to Symonds no run dropped full and creamed back at Hall s midriff technically a chance but it was really travelling and at this stage of the game there s not much point in heroics Hall to Symonds no run Symonds much more circumspect after the let off Nel to Clarke no run driven into the ground and Nel takes at chest height in his follow through Nel to Clarke no run chipped to mid on in the air but Nel would have needed to be Spiderman to have got across to that Nel to Clarke no run wide and smeared to point where Gibbs makes a good stop diving to his right Nel to Clarke no run into the ground Clarke ponders the single but the ball went no more a yard in front of him and Nel was wise to what he was thinking Nel to Clarke FOUR runs hit on the up over mid on and that s his fifty off balls Nel to Clarke no run checked drive with a sniff of an inside edge to mid on Hall to Symonds no run straight and Symonds very respectfully blocks Hall to Symonds no run swished off middle to midwicket where Kallis makes a decent stop even though he overshot once he had got a hand to the ball Hall to Symonds runs clipped off leg stump to deep backward square leg Hall to Symonds run Symonds heaves towards midwicket get a thick edge and the ball scoots down to third man Hall to Clarke no run pushed

Symonds run worked through square leg Hall to Clarke FOUR runs Clarke gives himself room and cracks that back from where it came with interest Hall to Clarke no ball run driven past extra cover and a no ball Hall to Symonds FOUR runs leg side full toss Symonds does the business with a swish through midwicket and that s Australia into their fourth successive final Pollock to Hayden no run cut to point Pollock to Hayden runs oh but he s off the mark now  Hayden s had enough of this block prod block malarkey picking up this half volley and dispatching it over midwicket for four  Not pretty but very Hayden esque Pollock to Ponting run that s a terrific line from Pollock on off stump and Ponting pushes it just past the bowler immediately Ponting sets off for a run and gets it much to Pollock s disgust Pollock to Hayden no run a squirted smudged yet purposeful inside edge to mid on Pollock to Hayden no run good length just outside off and Hayden is resolute in defence Pollock to Hayden FOUR runs oh he s definitely had enough now Hayden  A stroke of brute ugly power heaving it through midwicket flat for four Kallis to Ponting no run a touch too wide but a good length Ponting defends off the back foot back to Kallis Kallis to Ponting no run too straight from Kallis on Ponting s middle stump and he flicks his wrists to midwicket setting off for a single before Hayden sends him back Kallis to Ponting no run another big stride down the pitch from Ponting creaming it to cover  He looks in absurd touch Kallis to Ponting no run good length just drawing Ponting forward at good pace too and Ponting cracks it on the front foot opening the face of the bat to Gibbs at point Kallis to Ponting no run driven to extra cover Kallis to Ponting no run a textbook cover drive but straight to mid off Nel to Hayden no run and it s defended off the back foot Nel to Hayden run banged in short but it s down the leg side and Hayden works it down to fine leg  Nel falls over in his follow through as he so often does Nel to Ponting FOUR runs terrible ball a massive wide which Ponting just leans into stroking it through cover bisecting mid off and cover and it races for four  Absolutely no chance of stopping that Nel to Ponting run ooh that s better from Nel a tighter line which forces Ponting to defend   though it s padded away and they pick up a single Nel to Hayden run but it s too straight Nel not able to adjust his line and Hayden clips a single to leg Nel to Ponting no run driven to mid off Kallis to Hayden wide good bounce from Kallis but oh dear it s very wide of the off stump and rightly wided by the not so wide umpire Kallis to Hayden no run ooh and a play and a miss outside off fuller this time from Kallis and Hayden tries to late cut but the ball kept a touch low Kallis to Hayden no run crunched on the front foot to cover Kallis to Hayden no run hammered My word he very nearly killed short extra cover  Andrew Hall the fielder there Kallis to Hayden FOUR runs grief that is some shot from Hayden  No great foot movement flicked on the up through mid on for four  Extraordinary shot in fact Kallis to Hayden run pushed to mid off this time and he sets off for a single Kallis to Ponting no run worked to leg but no single on offer Nel to Hayden no run defended on the front foot Nel to Hayden no run just a touch wide giving Hayden the room to free his arms and he strokes it to cover but Hall does magnificently to prevent the single  Or the two three or indeed four Nel to Hayden no run tighter line and a fuller length which Hayden back cuts to point Nel to Hayden runs on leg stump Hayden leans on it and clips it through midwicket  But the man at deep midwicket makes a fumble allowing them through for two  Hall is not pleased and the stump mic picks up every word Nel to Ponting wide wide of the off stump left alone   but it s a wide Nel to Ponting no run down on one knee Ponting carves it to cover Kallis to Hayden run swinging into Hayden who works it through midwicket Kallis to Clarke leg bye drifting down Clarke s leg side and he works it off his pads Kallis to Hayden FOUR runs absolutely magnificent shot  The power   just breathless

Hayden pulls but for once can t get hold of it Nel to Clarke no run shuffled through bustling effort but that s just left alone outside off Clarke with all the time in the world cue Louis Armstrong song music Nel to Clarke no run more leaving Nel to Clarke no run a bit of wobble and no dobble as that one nips back in and that s defended forward Nel to Clarke no run more leaving this time that one outside off Nel to Clarke FOUR runs nice shot to get off the mark leaning into that one outside off on the front foot and Nel s furious with himself Nel to Clarke no run outside off and that s just defended forward Kallis to Hayden runs over the wicket by the way that s poked into the covers for a quick single and there s a very close shy from ABCdEV    ooh  Overthrows result Kallis to Hayden run dabbed out off the back foot out to deep point where it s winged back in without much fuss Kallis to Clarke no run left alone outside off Kallis to Clarke no run hostile bouncer Kallis finding some spring there with one which whistles past the grille  Good bouncing there Kallis to Clarke no run a tamer one this just floating down the channel and it s left alone easily Nel to Hayden run driven straight to long off Nel to Clarke no run outside off and Clarke launches into a cover drive but he doesn t time it very well at all Nel to Clarke no run left alone outside off Nel to Clarke no run bustled through down the channel and Clarke leaves it alone again Nel to Clarke run outside off and Clarke drives that again without total timing to the covers Nel to Hayden no run round the wicket and that s eased into the covers Kallis to Clarke run just to say strays onto leg and that s tucked into square Kallis to Hayden leg byes outside leg that would have been good to a righthander but he s a lefty of course and that s pawed round through fine leg Kallis to Hayden no run a touch of width outside off Hayden connects cleanly and cuts that to gully Kallis to Hayden run quick single to mid off Kallis to Clarke run on leg and that s tucked forward with some excellent placement in front of midwicket Hayden turned down the second Kallis to Hayden no ball run on off and Hayden fails to pull that cleanly in front of square ah an overstepped no ball is signalled and he rehearses the shot when he makes it to the non striker s end Kallis to Clarke run on leg bounces up and that s tucked into short midwicket Nel to Clarke no run left alone outside off Nel to Clarke no run a touch of width outside off and that s cut to point Nel to Clarke no run outside off short and Nel s really pleased with himself jogging through and laughing like Muttley  Clarke goes to play and then drops his hands at the last minute Nel to Clarke no run outside off again driven to the covers and again it s all about waiting on Nel to Clarke no run on off and that s driven to the covers Nel to Clarke no run more of the off side stuff tidy and that s defended down Langeveldt to Hayden run up there on off and that s driven back out to mid on Langeveldt to Clarke no run outside off dragged down a touch and that s poked off the back foot to the covers Langeveldt to Clarke no run outside

Kemp no run gets into a bit of a tangle Kemp here', ' A shorter delivery which rises up on him and he defends using his chest Watson to Gibbs FOUR runs what a magnificent shot from Gibbs a flick behind square which beats the man at deep square leg Watson to Gibbs no run and Gibbs drives with vast amounts of class here but straight to cover Watson to Gibbs no run much better from Watson that s the length and it s pumped back to the bowler Watson to Gibbs no run just a little wider this time from Watson and Gibbs is back and across pushing it out to cover Watson to Gibbs run a Watson slower ball which is nicely nudged off the front foot down to fine leg Watson to Kemp no run Kemp is less deft but he defends with a solid lunge of the front foot and pushes this back to the bowler Hogg to Gibbs no run quick on middle and leg and it s worked further to leg Hogg to Gibbs run again on leg stump quick and flat turned around the corner Hogg to Kemp no run well bowled on middle stump and Kemp comes forward massively defending it on the front foot Hogg to Kemp no run that s more like it from Kemp hammering it on the front foot and timing it very well but straight to cover Hogg to Kemp no run what a ball from the tongue master a wrong un which Kemp complete misreads coming forward trying to defend but missing it by a country mile Hogg to Kemp no run and again he s beaten Watson to Gibbs FOUR runs poor delivery short and straight Gibbs pulling it behind square Watson to Gibbs no run better Watson to Gibbs no run good idea from Watson who increasingly resembles the incredible hulk bouncing the batsman', '', '', 'but he s pretty settled now ducking underneath it easily Watson to Gibbs no run pushed back to the bowler and Gibbs gives him a stare', ' And why not Watson to Gibbs run calmly strokes past short extra cover Watson to Kemp run on middle and off Kemp lunges forward like a monster and defends Hogg to Kemp runs poor ball outside leg deftly paddled around the corner Hogg to Kemp run very well played again straighter this time and he plants his foot down the pitch and ladles it around the corner Hogg to Gibbs run flicked through midwicket Hogg to Kemp no run blocked out on the front foot Hogg to Kemp run a full bunger from Hogg punched through cover rather takes Kemp by surprise hence not trying to hit it into the USA Watson to Kemp no run defended on the front foot Watson to Kemp no run excellent ball on off stump and he comes forward to defend this out to cover Watson to Kemp no run ah now then that s more like it from Watson', ' An excellent bouncer which takes the batsman by surprise as he attempts to pull before deciding to leave it well alone Watson to Kemp runs Kemp late cuts this with oodles of time and class behind point and wide of third man who sprints to his right to field Watson to Kemp no run swinging into him it s defended on the front foot Watson to Kemp no run another good one just outside off', ' Watson bowling with

and quicker and defended Hogg to Gibbs no run beaten Terrific ball the wrong un which he plays at and misses Hogg s tongue slavers around uncontrollably Watson to Kemp no run on leg and that s skewed in front of square to the man there Watson to Kemp no run slower ball on the money and that s defended forward Watson to Kemp no run beautiful delivery that one nipping back in at the righthander and threatening to kiss the outside edge Watson to Kemp no run left alone this time Watson to Kemp SIX runs short and Kemp s on that one so quickly fending the ball with a hook right off his helmet top work that was close to him and although he didn t get hold of it properlyit sailed away', ' And that s the fifty partnership Watson to Kemp no run defended off the back foot into the covers Hogg to Gibbs run on leg the batsman comes forward and sweeps that round on the front foot behind square Hogg to Kemp run swept that round behind square Hogg to Gibbs no run the one that went the other way the ball not his tongue and that slavers outside off and is left alone easily Hogg to Gibbs run another ball on leg another sweep this one dinked as gentle as the others Hogg to Kemp run on middle doesn t read that one and a tentative prod from Kemp sends an outside edge backward of point Hogg to Gibbs wide outside leg chased round and that s just to say wide Hogg to Gibbs run on leg and that turns towards leg even more the batsman just poking that into short square Tait to Gibbs no run bouncer straight and high', ' Tait follows through with a serious look on his face he means more business here all right Tait to Gibbs FOUR runs outside off way too much width and Gibbs just opens his shoulders and swings hard and that one flies up off the base of the bat behind point not quite where he intended it but it fair raced away Tait to Gibbs no run pushes him back up there to defend into the covers Tait to Gibbs OUT got him this time A very very thin edge much thinner than the one which wasn t given earlier also to Tait looking for the short pitched delivery', ' His feet were just rooted in the crease there as he chased the ball away from his body Tait to Hall no run good pace right up there and scattering a cloud of dust as Hall edges that low on the front foot and unconvincingly down towards the slip region Hogg to Kemp no run up there again on middle and that s defended once more on the front foot again Hogg to Kemp no run pitches on middle moves to off and Kemp s not sure how to play that he tries to sweep doesn t really get hold of the ball Hogg to Kemp no run defended again Kemp not looking at all comfortable Hogg to Kemp wide wide down off Kemp backs away to give himself room to cut but that one went the other way and he was miles away from it Hogg to Kemp wide another wide down off', ' By George Hogg can t believe that one not sure why it was very wide Hogg to Kemp no run defended this time Hogg to Kemp no run comes forward and defends that one on the front foot', ' Not much fuss about that shot Tait to Hall no run awkward bounce to deal with that one but Hall stays cool as ever defending down off the back foot Tait to Hall run gets his yorker line all wrong and that s worked off the toes out to Mr Hussey Cricket on the deep square boundary and he does a slide and relay with McGrath Tait to Kemp no run left alone outside off this time Tait to Kemp no run better yorker this time obviously the length was right as before but this time it was on the toes and that s just defended forward Tait to Kemp no run bouncer down the channel and Kemp leaves that one alone Tait to Kemp no run another bouncer straight and that s well avoided Hogg to Hall no run tosses that one up it dips naughtily at the last minute and the batsman rolls out a tame forward drive Hogg to Hall run swished off the toes to short midwicket Hogg to Kemp no run right up there and there s a play and a miss Hogg to Kemp run some room outside off the batsman waits and cuts that away into the covers with a mere tuck of a cut Hogg to Hall run turning away towards off again this shot isn t so neat an ugly chop down yet again into the covers Tait to Nel OUT short and wide slashed high to backward point who backpeddled and took an easy catch above his head Tait to Kemp no run slower ball if you can describe mph as slower and Langeveldt into line to block Tait to Kemp no run faster and a bit shorter Langeveldt sways out of the way', ' It probably would have missed him anyway Tait to Kemp no run full Langeveldt winds up and drives the ball to Hogg at mid off Tait to Kemp wide Tait loses his bearings and spears one down the leg side Tait to Kemp no run full and this time on target Kemp defends Tait to Kemp run quite deliberately and safely steered down to third man', ' Kemp keeps the strike Watson to Kemp FOUR runs Watson attempts the yorker doesn t quite get it right and Kemp slams a full toss back over the bowler s head Watson to Kemp run full driven almost as hard but there is a long off in place Watson to Langeveldt no run Langeveldt heads towards the square leg umpire and blocks Watson to Langeveldt run decent ball which Langeveldt swings at hits and the ball arcs short of the man out in the deep on the off side Watson to Kemp FOUR runs another full toss from Watson which Kemp absolutely smears through extra cover Watson to Kemp no run slower ball but Kemp can t find the single he needs leaving Langeveldt exposed Tait to Hall OUT and Tait strikes again Hall looked to lash that off the back foot through cover but his feet must have been dipped in the same tub of superglue as Gibbs s as he strikes at the ball away from the body and a thickish edge rips through', ' Gilchrist makes no mistake Tait to Pollock no run oh Pollock was lucky to survive there this one nipping back in off the seam and Pollock doing his valiant best to give Gilchrist another catching opportunity but failed to get hold of it Tait to Pollock no run right up there and that s poked into the covers', ' A bit of shuffling from Hogg in his sunhat as he takes his time to throw down the stumps', ' It looked in and replays quickly confirmed it was Tait to Pollock run bouncer crashes into Pollock s gloves at just crouching height Pollock did well to shield his body there but he s not looking comfortable Tait to Kemp no run plays that away from his body poking it down to gully off the back foot Tait to Kemp no run more grunting from Tait and that s up there defended just outside off and just in front of yorker length Bracken to Pollock no run he s over the wicket and that s defended forward first up Bracken to Pollock no run across the righthander again and that s defended into the covers Bracken to Pollock no run on middle and off Pollock plays that into the covers in a very defensive manner Bracken to Pollock no run straight a touch short and defended easily enough on the back foot this time Bracken to Pollock no run outside off Pollock tries to cut that off the back foot through point but chops an inside edge down into the ground safely enough Bracken to Langeveldt run Langeveldt drops into the leg side and runs', ' McGrath teapots that the No', ' was allowed to get off strike first ball Bracken to Kemp run Kemp sweeps Bracken appeals thinking it missed the bat but Bucknor disagrees Bracken to Langeveldt no run driven into the covers Bracken to Langeveldt no run punched square on the off side Bracken to Langeveldt no run Langeveldt misses with a swish to leg strangled appeal as it again pitched outside the line Bracken to Langeveldt no run defended into the off side a quiet over but at least Kemp keeps the strike Watson to Kemp no run Kemp heaves over midwicket to Hayden in the deep but they decide not to run Watson to Kemp run driven straight to Tait at long on it went high but right to him', ' he caught it dropped it juggled the rebound before ending up in a big heap with the ball next to him Watson to Langeveldt no run a big heave and a big miss Watson to Langeveldt FOUR runs another heave from Langeveldt who is heading towards square leg as he plays it over point and over the rope Watson to Langeveldt OUT up in the block hole and Langeveldt again giving himself room is in no position to play it and is cleaned up Bracken to Smith run uppish and loose pushed drive in the air but into space

            " am Good morning and welcome to our coverage of the second semi final between Australia and South Africa with the winners taking on Sri Lanka in Saturday s final. Team and toss news to follow any second . Bracken to Smith run uppish and loose pushed drive in the air but into space third man fields Bracken to de Villiers no run wide of off stump plenty of swing aided by a stiff breeze and de Villiers leaves Bracken to de Villiers no run again that swung into the right hander de Villiers into line and drops into the leg side Bracken to de Villiers no run a similar line de Villiers pushes the ball no more than five or six yards into the leg side Bracken to de Villiers no run outside off and wide enough to leave Bracken to de Villiers FOUR runs de Villiers pushes forward a thick edge shoots along the ground to the right of solitary slip and the ball flies across the outfield McGrath to Smith run Smith whips that from middle and leg into the on side an easy run to the man in the deep McGrath to de Villiers wide that started wide of off and swung significantly an easy wide to call and Gilchrist had to scurry across to gather McGrath to de Villiers no run better line and less swing de Villiers leaves it alone McGrath to de Villiers no run massive shout as de Villiers took a half stride and misses. Aleem Dar shakes his head McGrath to de Villiers no run outside off and no alarms this time as the batsman leaves it McGrath to de Villiers no run McGrath finds the edge and it drops just short of Ponting at second slip Bracken to Smith no run Smith takes a stroll down the pitch before Bracken is even in his delivery stride prods and misses Bracken to Smith no run this time Smith stays anchored to the crease and pushes into the covers Bracken to Smith OUT Smith again walks down the pitch to meet the ball shapes to hit over the top and a sniff of swing takes the ball past the bat and into the off stump Bracken to Kallis no run Kallis spars and misses one outside off much oohing and aahing among players crowd and Cricinfo staff. mph for speed freaks. Bracken to Kallis no run wider and Kallis able to watch that pass Bracken to Kallis no run mph and Kallis plays a slightly hurried defensive jab McGrath to de Villiers no run wide and left McGrath to de Villiers no run McGrath continues with his nagging line fractionally outside off mph and de Villiers not tempted to nibble . yet McGrath to de Villiers no run fractionally too wide and McGrath looks to the heavens as he knows that s not quite the right line McGrath to de Villiers no run quicker mph and de Villiers drawn forward and then leaves with a theatrical flourish McGrath to de Villiers no run pushed defensive shot a thick inside edge and the ball dribbles into the leg side McGrath to de Villiers no run on target de Villiers into line and plays into the leg side Bracken to Kallis no run punched off the back foot into the covers and all with one hand as the bottom one slips off the handle as he plays the stroke Bracken to Kallis no run a strangled appeal as the ball hits Kallis high on the pad . he had taken two big steps down the pitch Bracken to Kallis run a rather limp drive between cover fielders muted cheers and a solitary horn welcome the run to the man in the deep Bracken to de Villiers no run a grunt from Bracken and then a delivery wide off off stump which de Villiers leaves Bracken to de Villiers no run de Villiers back into line and blocks into the off Bracken to de Villiers no run another good over ends with a leave from de Villiers McGrath to Kallis no run Kallis not remotely tempted as the ball passes by and Gilchrist takes by his feet McGrath to Kallis FOUR runs Kallis dances down the track McGrath sees him step to leg follows him but Kallis still punches that past extra cover McGrath to Kallis OUT Kallis again gives himself room and advances to meet the ball but McGrath fires in a yorker which clatters into the off stump McGrath to Gibbs no run mph from McGrath. Either the old man is fired up or as has happened a few times the speed gun is up the creek. Anyhow outside off and Gibbs watches and leaves McGrath to Gibbs run half volley outside off driven to Hogg at mid off and they scurry through for a quick single McGrath to de Villiers FOUR runs McGrath drops short de Villiers on it in a flash and smashes that past a diving short midwicket. That was really clobbered Bracken to Gibbs run wide and a slashed drive races to deep backward point Bracken to de Villiers run pushed to mid on Watson picks up and throws at the bowler s end de Villiers was out had the ball hit. At for that was just daft Bracken to Gibbs no run left alone Bracken to Gibbs run Gibbs shapes to flick to leg gets a thick edge via pad and the ball plops into the on side Bracken to de Villiers no run de Villiers happy to leave one a foot outside the off Bracken to de Villiers run driven firmly to the left of mid off and that placement allows for the easy single McGrath to de Villiers no run McGrath starts his fourth over with a loosener outside off McGrath to de Villiers no run slightly closer to the off stump but again the batsman not lured into anything McGrath to de Villiers no run pushed into the off side pounced on like a fly in a Venus thingytrap McGrath to de Villiers no run Glichrist takes that as de Villiers ushers it by McGrath to de Villiers no run stock McGrath delivery niggly and just outside off McGrath to de Villiers run de Villiers leaps out of his crease to meet the ball and square drives to the sweeper Tait to de Villiers FOUR runs Tait opens with a bouncer at mph and it s almost as if de Villiers has been sent advanced notice he s on it so fast and hammers that over midwicket Tait to de Villiers no run fired in at almost mph and de Villiers blocks off the back foot Tait to de Villiers no run slower ball . mph and de Villiers is almost early on the attempted pull. It did keep low outside off . Tait to de Villiers no run short another mph delivery and de Villiers sways back just in case Tait to de Villiers OUT full de Villiers drives with no foot movement and a thick kick carries straight to Gilchrist. A fourth delivery over mph a good mixture of length and now South Africa are up against it Tait to Prince no run right back and drops the ball at his feet McGrath to Gibbs no run McGrath seems almost a spinner after watching Tait . good line good length and defended McGrath to Gibbs no run Gibbs thrusts his pad down the pitch covering any movement and then opts to leave McGrath to Gibbs run McGrath drifts to leg seriously and Gibbs turns the ball just in front of square McGrath to Prince OUT And that might be it . about the worst ball McGrath has bowled wide and angled away from the left hander but Prince slashes gets a thin edge and Gilchrist does the rest McGrath to Boucher OUT McGrath on a hat trick . much better ball a stock McGrath delivery Boucher plays a nothing prod and the ball is held low down by Matthew Hayden at first slip McGrath to Kemp no run oh my goodness . Kemp leaves and the ball passes knee shakingly close to his off stump. Good judgment . but a great over from McGrath. Tait to Gibbs no run and another But Bucknor doesn t raise his finger. A fierce inswinger as Gibbs goes right back inside edges it to Gilchrist who tumbles to his left but.Bucknor refuses to raise his finger Tait to Gibbs FOUR runs and he crashes this on the front foot but it s just wide of the lone slip and I reiterate there s just one slip in there Tait to Gibbs FOUR runs fabulous shot. The most textbook of cover drives creaming it on the front foot through extra cover Tait to Gibbs no run ooh well bowled Tait cutting this back into Gibbs who is back into his crease rather late on it defending off the back foot Tait to Gibbs no run shorter this time from Tait and he grunts in doing so forcing Gibbs back into his crease and he defends off the back foot Tait to Gibbs no run very well bowled from Tait who has so far been far from the scattergun. In fact he s been sniper like a . mph ish kph inswinger which Gibbs is very late on nudging it to leg McGrath to Kemp run Short and quick from McGrath McGrath to Gibbs no run classic McGrath cutting this back into him and it s defended solidly McGrath to Gibbs no run right in the channel there absolutely perfect line just outside off stump and he comes forward rather tentatively defending it back to McGrath McGrath to Gibbs no run and McGrath is in once again chugging up to the crease and again lands it on a sixpenny and Gibbs is forced to block it out on the front foot McGrath to Gibbs no run ever so slightly wider from McGrath the teaser McGrath to Gibbs no run Gibbs again leaves it alone outside off Tait to Kemp leg bye Another prehistoric grunt from Tait as he flings this down but it s a little too straight and worked off his pads Tait to Gibbs FOUR runs outside off Gibbs plants his foot and slashes it over the slips not far off at all Tait to Gibbs no run ah very good comeback from Tait just pitching it up a smidgen more Tait to Gibbs run oh hello a Tait slower ball. That s new or at least I ve not seen it much before. Gibbs reads it though and on the front foot neatly guides it down to third man with surprising deftness Tait to Kemp wide oh dear Tait s replaced his sniper rifle with the greater spotted potato gun. This is miles down the leg side and Gilchrist doesn t have a chance Tait to Kemp no run on off stump this time much better and it s firmly defended Tait to Kemp no run cracking ball at high pace swinging into the right hander who digs it out at the very last moment. A yorker in fact Bracken to Gibbs run and he starts lazily drifting it down the leg side and Gibbs plucks it with ease to leg Bracken to Kemp run ooh close A lovely delivery angling across a very nervous Justin Kemp who even more nervously pushes forward without conviction and edges it past the second slip Bracken to Gibbs no run defended on the front foot Bracken to Gibbs run ah delightful shot coming forward on the front foot and just working it smudging it through midwicket Bracken to Kemp no run gets into a bit of a tangle Kemp here. A shorter delivery which rises up on him and he defends using his chest Watson to Gibbs FOUR runs what a magnificent shot from Gibbs a flick behind square which beats the man at deep square leg Watson to Gibbs no run and Gibbs drives with vast amounts of class here but straight to cover Watson to Gibbs no run much better from Watson that s the length and it s pumped back to the bowler Watson to Gibbs no run just a little wider this time from Watson and Gibbs is back and across pushing it out to cover Watson to Gibbs run a Watson slower ball which is nicely nudged off the front foot down to fine leg Watson to Kemp no run Kemp is less deft but he defends with a solid lunge of the front foot and pushes this back to the bowler Hogg to Gibbs no run quick on middle and leg and it s worked further to leg Hogg to Gibbs run again on leg stump quick and flat turned around the corner Hogg to Kemp no run well bowled on middle stump and Kemp comes forward massively defending it on the front foot Hogg to Kemp no run that s more like it from Kemp hammering it on the front foot and timing it very well but straight to cover Hogg to Kemp no run what a ball from the tongue master a wrong un which Kemp complete misreads coming forward trying to defend but missing it by a country mile Hogg to Kemp no run and again he s beaten Watson to Gibbs FOUR runs poor delivery short and straight Gibbs pulling it behind square Watson to Gibbs no run better Watson to Gibbs no run good idea from Watson who increasingly resembles the incredible hulk bouncing the batsman.but he s pretty settled now ducking underneath it easily Watson to Gibbs no run pushed back to the bowler and Gibbs gives him a stare. And why not Watson to Gibbs run calmly strokes past short extra cover Watson to Kemp run on middle and off Kemp lunges forward like a monster and defends Hogg to Kemp runs poor ball outside leg deftly paddled around the corner Hogg to Kemp run very well played again straighter this time and he plants his foot down the pitch and ladles it around the corner Hogg to Gibbs run flicked through midwicket Hogg to Kemp no run blocked out on the front foot Hogg to Kemp run a full bunger from Hogg punched through cover rather takes Kemp by surprise hence not trying to hit it into the USA Watson to Kemp no run defended on the front foot Watson to Kemp no run excellent ball on off stump and he comes forward to defend this out to cover Watson to Kemp no run ah now then that s more like it from Watson. An excellent bouncer which takes the batsman by surprise as he attempts to pull before deciding to leave it well alone Watson to Kemp runs Kemp late cuts this with oodles of time and class behind point and wide of third man who sprints to his right to field Watson to Kemp no run swinging into him it s defended on the front foot Watson to Kemp no run another good one just outside off. Watson bowling with excellent control so far and it s blocked out Hogg to Gibbs run on leg stump picked off for a single Hogg to Kemp no run ooh this one holds up on him just outside off spinning back into him and jumping up a touch it s blocked out Hogg to Kemp no run full and straight blocked out Hogg to Kemp no run and he plays and misses outside off the arm ball there Hogg to Kemp run on leg stump flatter and quicker and defended Hogg to Gibbs no run beaten Terrific ball the wrong un which he plays at and misses Hogg s tongue slavers around uncontrollably Watson to Kemp no run on leg and that s skewed in front of square to the man there Watson to Kemp no run slower ball on the money and that s defended forward Watson to Kemp no run beautiful delivery that one nipping back in at the righthander and threatening to kiss the outside edge Watson to Kemp no run left alone this time Watson to Kemp SIX runs short and Kemp s on that one so quickly fending the ball with a hook right off his helmet top work that was close to him and although he didn t get hold of it properlyit sailed away. And that s the fifty partnership Watson to Kemp no run defended off the back foot into the covers Hogg to Gibbs run on leg the batsman comes forward and sweeps that round on the front foot behind square Hogg to Kemp run swept that round behind square Hogg to Gibbs no run the one that went the other way the ball not his tongue and that slavers outside off and is left alone easily Hogg to Gibbs run another ball on leg another sweep this one dinked as gentle as the others Hogg to Kemp run on middle doesn t read that one and a tentative prod from Kemp sends an outside edge backward of point Hogg to Gibbs wide outside leg chased round and that s just to say wide Hogg to Gibbs run on leg and that turns towards leg even more the batsman just poking that into short square Tait to Gibbs no run bouncer straight and high. Tait follows through with a serious look on his face he means more business here all right Tait to Gibbs FOUR runs outside off way too much width and Gibbs just opens his shoulders and swings hard and that one flies up off the base of the bat behind point not quite where he intended it but it fair raced away Tait to Gibbs no run pushes him back up there to defend into the covers Tait to Gibbs OUT got him this time A very very thin edge much thinner than the one which wasn t given earlier also to Tait looking for the short pitched delivery. His feet were just rooted in the crease there as he chased the ball away from his body Tait to Hall no run good pace right up there and scattering a cloud of dust as Hall edges that low on the front foot and unconvincingly down towards the slip region Hogg to Kemp no run up there again on middle and that s defended once more on the front foot again Hogg to Kemp no run pitches on middle moves to off and Kemp s not sure how to play that he tries to sweep doesn t really get hold of the ball Hogg to Kemp no run defended again Kemp not looking at all comfortable Hogg to Kemp wide wide down off Kemp backs away to give himself room to cut but that one went the other way and he was miles away from it Hogg to Kemp wide another wide down off. By George Hogg can t believe that one not sure why it was very wide Hogg to Kemp no run defended this time Hogg to Kemp no run comes forward and defends that one on the front foot. Not much fuss about that shot Tait to Hall no run awkward bounce to deal with that one but Hall stays cool as ever defending down off the back foot Tait to Hall run gets his yorker line all wrong and that s worked off the toes out to Mr Hussey Cricket on the deep square boundary and he does a slide and relay with McGrath Tait to Kemp no run left alone outside off this time Tait to Kemp no run better yorker this time obviously the length was right as before but this time it was on the toes and that s just defended forward Tait to Kemp no run bouncer down the channel and Kemp leaves that one alone Tait to Kemp no run another bouncer straight and that s well avoided Hogg to Hall no run tosses that one up it dips naughtily at the last minute and the batsman rolls out a tame forward drive Hogg to Hall run swished off the toes to short midwicket Hogg to Kemp no run right up there and there s a play and a miss Hogg to Kemp run some room outside off the batsman waits and cuts that away into the covers with a mere tuck of a cut Hogg to Hall run turning away towards off again this shot isn t so neat an ugly chop down yet again into the covers Tait to Nel OUT short and wide slashed high to backward point who backpeddled and took an easy catch above his head Tait to Kemp no run slower ball if you can describe mph as slower and Langeveldt into line to block Tait to Kemp no run faster and a bit shorter Langeveldt sways out of the way. It probably would have missed him anyway Tait to Kemp no run full Langeveldt winds up and drives the ball to Hogg at mid off Tait to Kemp wide Tait loses his bearings and spears one down the leg side Tait to Kemp no run full and this time on target Kemp defends Tait to Kemp run quite deliberately and safely steered down to third man. Kemp keeps the strike Watson to Kemp FOUR runs Watson attempts the yorker doesn t quite get it right and Kemp slams a full toss back over the bowler s head Watson to Kemp run full driven almost as hard but there is a long off in place Watson to Langeveldt no run Langeveldt heads towards the square leg umpire and blocks Watson to Langeveldt run decent ball which Langeveldt swings at hits and the ball arcs short of the man out in the deep on the off side Watson to Kemp FOUR runs another full toss from Watson which Kemp absolutely smears through extra cover Watson to Kemp no run slower ball but Kemp can t find the single he needs leaving Langeveldt exposed Tait to Hall OUT and Tait strikes again Hall looked to lash that off the back foot through cover but his feet must have been dipped in the same tub of superglue as Gibbs s as he strikes at the ball away from the body and a thickish edge rips through. Gilchrist makes no mistake Tait to Pollock no run oh Pollock was lucky to survive there this one nipping back in off the seam and Pollock doing his valiant best to give Gilchrist another catching opportunity but failed to get hold of it Tait to Pollock no run right up there and that s poked into the covers. A bit of shuffling from Hogg in his sunhat as he takes his time to throw down the stumps. It looked in and replays quickly confirmed it was Tait to Pollock run bouncer crashes into Pollock s gloves at just crouching height Pollock did well to shield his body there but he s not looking comfortable Tait to Kemp no run plays that away from his body poking it down to gully off the back foot Tait to Kemp no run more grunting from Tait and that s up there defended just outside off and just in front of yorker length Bracken to Pollock no run he s over the wicket and that s defended forward first up Bracken to Pollock no run across the righthander again and that s defended into the covers Bracken to Pollock no run on middle and off Pollock plays that into the covers in a very defensive manner Bracken to Pollock no run straight a touch short and defended easily enough on the back foot this time Bracken to Pollock no run outside off Pollock tries to cut that off the back foot through point but chops an inside edge down into the ground safely enough Bracken to Langeveldt run Langeveldt drops into the leg side and runs. McGrath teapots that the No. was allowed to get off strike first ball Bracken to Kemp run Kemp sweeps Bracken appeals thinking it missed the bat but Bucknor disagrees Bracken to Langeveldt no run driven into the covers Bracken to Langeveldt no run punched square on the off side Bracken to Langeveldt no run Langeveldt misses with a swish to leg strangled appeal as it again pitched outside the line Bracken to Langeveldt no run defended into the off side a quiet over but at least Kemp keeps the strike Watson to Kemp no run Kemp heaves over midwicket to Hayden in the deep but they decide not to run Watson to Kemp run driven straight to Tait at long on it went high but right to him. he caught it dropped it juggled the rebound before ending up in a big heap with the ball next to him Watson to Langeveldt no run a big heave and a big miss Watson to Langeveldt FOUR runs another heave from Langeveldt who is heading towards square leg as he plays it over point and over the rope Watson to Langeveldt OUT up in the block hole and Langeveldt again giving himself room is in no position to play it and is cleaned up Bracken to Smith run uppish and loose pushed drive in the air but into space third man fields Bracken to de Villiers no run wide of off stump plenty of swing aided by a stiff breeze and de Villiers leaves Bracken to de Villiers no run again that swung into the right hander de Villiers into line and drops into the leg side Bracken to de Villiers no run a similar line de Villiers pushes the ball no more than five or six yards into the leg side Bracken to de Villiers no run outside off and wide enough to leave Bracken to de Villiers FOUR runs de Villiers pushes forward a thick edge shoots along the ground to the right of solitary slip and the ball flies across the outfield McGrath to Smith run Smith whips that from middle and leg into the on side an easy run to the man in the deep McGrath to de Villiers wide that started wide of off and swung significantly an easy wide to call and Gilchrist had to scurry across to gather McGrath to de Villiers no run better line and less swing de Villiers leaves it alone McGrath to de Villiers no run massive shout as de Villiers took a half stride and misses. Aleem Dar shakes his head McGrath to de Villiers no run outside off and no alarms this time as the batsman leaves it McGrath to de Villiers no run McGrath finds the edge and it drops just short of Ponting at second slip Bracken to Smith no run Smith takes a stroll down the pitch before Bracken is even in his delivery stride prods and misses Bracken to Smith no run this time Smith stays anchored to the crease and pushes into the covers Bracken to Smith OUT Smith again walks down the pitch to meet the ball shapes to hit over the top and a sniff of swing takes the ball past the bat and into the off stump Bracken to Kallis no run Kallis spars and misses one outside off much oohing and aahing among players crowd and Cricinfo staff. mph for speed freaks. Bracken to Kallis no run wider and Kallis able to watch that pass Bracken to Kallis no run mph and Kallis plays a slightly hurried defensive jab McGrath to de Villiers no run wide and left McGrath to de Villiers no run McGrath continues with his nagging line fractionally outside off mph and de Villiers not tempted to nibble . yet McGrath to de Villiers no run fractionally too wide and McGrath looks to the heavens as he knows that s not quite the right line McGrath to de Villiers no run quicker mph and de Villiers drawn forward and then leaves with a theatrical flourish McGrath to de Villiers no run pushed defensive shot a thick inside edge and the ball dribbles into the leg side McGrath to de Villiers no run on target de Villiers into line and plays into the leg side Bracken to Kallis no run punched off the back foot into the covers and all with one hand as the bottom one slips off the handle as he plays the stroke Bracken to Kallis no run a strangled appeal as the ball hits Kallis high on the pad . he had taken two big steps down the pitch Bracken to Kallis run a rather limp drive between cover fielders muted cheers and a solitary horn welcome the run to the man in the deep Bracken to de Villiers no run a grunt from Bracken and then a delivery wide off off stump which de Villiers leaves Bracken to de Villiers no run de Villiers back into line and blocks into the off Bracken to de Villiers no run another good over ends with a leave from de Villiers McGrath to Kallis no run Kallis not remotely tempted as the ball passes by and Gilchrist takes by his feet McGrath to Kallis FOUR runs Kallis dances down the track McGrath sees him step to leg follows him but Kallis still punches that past extra cover McGrath to Kallis OUT Kallis again gives himself room and advances to meet the ball but McGrath fires in a yorker which clatters into the off stump McGrath to Gibbs no run mph from McGrath. Either the old man is fired up or as has happened a few times the speed gun is up the creek. Anyhow outside off and Gibbs watches and leaves McGrath to Gibbs run half volley outside off driven to Hogg at mid off and they scurry through for a quick single McGrath to de Villiers FOUR runs McGrath drops short de Villiers on it in a flash and smashes that past a diving short midwicket. That was really clobbered Bracken to Gibbs run wide and a slashed drive races to deep backward point Bracken to de Villiers run pushed to mid on Watson picks up and throws at the bowler s end de Villiers was out had the ball hit. At for that was just daft Bracken to Gibbs no run left alone Bracken to Gibbs run Gibbs shapes to flick to leg gets a thick edge via pad and the ball plops into the on side Bracken to de Villiers no run de Villiers happy to leave one a foot outside the off Bracken to de Villiers run driven firmly to the left of mid off and that placement allows for the easy single McGrath to de Villiers no run McGrath starts his fourth over with a loosener outside off McGrath to de Villiers no run slightly closer to the off stump but again the batsman not lured into anything McGrath to de Villiers no run pushed into the off side pounced on like a fly in a Venus thingytrap McGrath to de Villiers no run Glichrist takes that as de Villiers ushers it by McGrath to de Villiers no run stock McGrath delivery niggly and just outside off McGrath to de Villiers run de Villiers leaps out of his crease to meet the ball and square drives to the sweeper Tait to de Villiers FOUR runs Tait opens with a bouncer at mph and it s almost as if de Villiers has been sent advanced notice he s on it so fast and hammers that over midwicket Tait to de Villiers no run fired in at almost mph and de Villiers blocks off the back foot Tait to de Villiers no run slower ball . mph and de Villiers is almost early on the attempted pull. It did keep low outside off . Tait to de Villiers no run short another mph delivery and de Villiers sways back just in case Tait to de Villiers OUT full de Villiers drives with no foot movement and a thick kick carries straight to Gilchrist. A fourth delivery over mph a good mixture of length and now South Africa are up against it Tait to Prince no run right back and drops the ball at his feet McGrath to Gibbs no run McGrath seems almost a spinner after watching Tait . good line good length and defended McGrath to Gibbs no run Gibbs thrusts his pad down the pitch covering any movement and then opts to leave McGrath to Gibbs run McGrath drifts to leg seriously and Gibbs turns the ball just in front of square McGrath to Prince OUT And that might be it . about the worst ball McGrath has bowled wide and angled away from the left hander but Prince slashes gets a thin edge and Gilchrist does the rest McGrath to Boucher OUT McGrath on a hat trick . much better ball a stock McGrath delivery Boucher plays a nothing prod and the ball is held low down by Matthew Hayden at first slip McGrath to Kemp no run oh my goodness . Kemp leaves and the ball passes knee shakingly close to his off stump. Good judgment . but a great over from McGrath. Tait to Gibbs no run and another But Bucknor doesn t raise his finger. A fierce inswinger as Gibbs goes right back inside edges it to Gilchrist who tumbles to his left but.Bucknor refuses to raise his finger Tait to Gibbs FOUR runs and he crashes this on the front foot but it s just wide of the lone slip and I reiterate there s just one slip in there Tait to Gibbs FOUR runs fabulous shot. The most textbook of cover drives creaming it on the front foot through extra cover Tait to Gibbs no run ooh well bowled Tait cutting this back into Gibbs who is back into his crease rather late on it defending off the back foot Tait to Gibbs no run shorter this time from Tait and he grunts in doing so forcing Gibbs back into his crease and he defends off the back foot Tait to Gibbs no run very well bowled from Tait who has so far been far from the scattergun. In fact he s been sniper like a . mph ish kph inswinger which Gibbs is very late on nudging it to leg McGrath to Kemp run Short and quick from McGrath McGrath to Gibbs no run classic McGrath cutting this back into him and it s defended solidly McGrath to Gibbs no run right in the channel there absolutely perfect line just outside off stump and he comes forward rather tentatively defending it back to McGrath McGrath to Gibbs no run and McGrath is in once again chugging up to the crease and again lands it on a sixpenny and Gibbs is forced to block it out on the front foot McGrath to Gibbs no run ever so slightly wider from McGrath the teaser McGrath to Gibbs no run Gibbs again leaves it alone outside off Tait to Kemp leg bye Another prehistoric grunt from Tait as he flings this down but it s a little too straight and worked off his pads Tait to Gibbs FOUR runs outside off Gibbs plants his foot and slashes it over the slips not far off at all Tait to Gibbs no run ah very good comeback from Tait just pitching it up a smidgen more Tait to Gibbs run oh hello a Tait slower ball. That s new or at least I ve not seen it much before. Gibbs reads it though and on the front foot neatly guides it down to third man with surprising deftness Tait to Kemp wide oh dear Tait s replaced his sniper rifle with the greater spotted potato gun. This is miles down the leg side and Gilchrist doesn t have a chance Tait to Kemp no run on off stump this time much better and it s firmly defended Tait to Kemp no run cracking ball at high pace swinging into the right hander who digs it out at the very last moment. A yorker in fact Bracken to Gibbs run and he starts lazily drifting it down the leg side and Gibbs plucks it with ease to leg Bracken to Kemp run ooh close A lovely delivery angling across a very nervous Justin Kemp who even more nervously pushes forward without conviction and edges it past the second slip Bracken to Gibbs no run defended on the front foot Bracken to Gibbs run ah delightful shot coming forward on the front foot and just working it smudging it through midwicket Bracken to Kemp no run gets into a bit of a tangle Kemp here. A shorter delivery which rises up on him and he defends using his chest Watson to Gibbs FOUR runs what a magnificent shot from Gibbs a flick behind square which beats the man at deep square leg Watson to Gibbs no run and Gibbs drives with vast amounts of class here but straight to cover Watson to Gibbs no run much better from Watson that s the length and it s pumped back to the bowler Watson to Gibbs no run just a little wider this time from Watson and Gibbs is back and across pushing it out to cover Watson to Gibbs run a Watson slower ball which is nicely nudged off the front foot down to fine leg Watson to Kemp no run Kemp is less deft but he defends with a solid lunge of the front foot and pushes this back to the bowler Hogg to Gibbs no run quick on middle and leg and it s worked further to leg Hogg to Gibbs run again on leg stump quick and flat turned around the corner Hogg to Kemp no run well bowled on middle stump and Kemp comes forward massively defending it on the front foot Hogg to Kemp no run that s more like it from Kemp hammering it on the front foot and timing it very well but straight to cover Hogg to Kemp no run what a ball from the tongue master a wrong un which Kemp complete misreads coming forward trying to defend but missing it by a country mile Hogg to Kemp no run and again he s beaten Watson to Gibbs FOUR runs poor delivery short and straight Gibbs pulling it behind square Watson to Gibbs no run better Watson to Gibbs no run good idea from Watson who increasingly resembles the incredible hulk bouncing the batsman.but he s pretty settled now ducking underneath it easily Watson to Gibbs no run pushed back to the bowler and Gibbs gives him a stare. And why not Watson to Gibbs run calmly strokes past short extra cover Watson to Kemp run on middle and off Kemp lunges forward like a monster and defends Hogg to Kemp runs poor ball outside leg deftly paddled around the corner Hogg to Kemp run very well played again straighter this time and he plants his foot down the pitch and ladles it around the corner Hogg to Gibbs run flicked through midwicket Hogg to Kemp no run blocked out on the front foot Hogg to Kemp run a full bunger from Hogg punched through cover rather takes Kemp by surprise hence not trying to hit it into the USA Watson to Kemp no run defended on the front foot Watson to Kemp no run excellent ball on off stump and he comes forward to defend this out to cover Watson to Kemp no run ah now then that s more like it from Watson. An excellent bouncer which takes the batsman by surprise as he attempts to pull before deciding to leave it well alone Watson to Kemp runs Kemp late cuts this with oodles of time and class behind point and wide of third man who sprints to his right to field Watson to Kemp no run swinging into him it s defended on the front foot Watson to Kemp no run another good one just outside off. Watson bowling with excellent control so far and it s blocked out Hogg to Gibbs run on leg stump picked off for a single Hogg to Kemp no run ooh this one holds up on him just outside off spinning back into him and jumping up a touch it s blocked out Hogg to Kemp no run full and straight blocked out Hogg to Kemp no run and he plays and misses outside off the arm ball there Hogg to Kemp run on leg stump flatter and quicker and defended Hogg to Gibbs no run beaten Terrific ball the wrong un which he plays at and misses Hogg s tongue slavers around uncontrollably Watson to Kemp no run on leg and that s skewed in front of square to the man there Watson to Kemp no run slower ball on the money and that s defended forward Watson to Kemp no run beautiful delivery that one nipping back in at the righthander and threatening to kiss the outside edge Watson to Kemp no run left alone this time Watson to Kemp SIX runs short and Kemp s on that one so quickly fending the ball with a hook right off his helmet top work that was close to him and although he didn t get hold of it properlyit sailed away. And that s the fifty partnership Watson to Kemp no run defended off the back foot into the covers Hogg to Gibbs run on leg the batsman comes forward and sweeps that round on the front foot behind square Hogg to Kemp run swept that round behind square Hogg to Gibbs no run the one that went the other way the ball not his tongue and that slavers outside off and is left alone easily Hogg to Gibbs run another ball on leg another sweep this one dinked as gentle as the others Hogg to Kemp run on middle doesn t read that one and a tentative prod from Kemp sends an outside edge backward of point Hogg to Gibbs wide outside leg chased round and that s just to say wide Hogg to Gibbs run on leg and that turns towards leg even more the batsman just poking that into short square Tait to Gibbs no run bouncer straight and high. Tait follows through with a serious look on his face he means more business here all right Tait to Gibbs FOUR runs outside off way too much width and Gibbs just opens his shoulders and swings hard and that one flies up off the base of the bat behind point not quite where he intended it but it fair raced away Tait to Gibbs no run pushes him back up there to defend into the covers Tait to Gibbs OUT got him this time A very very thin edge much thinner than the one which wasn t given earlier also to Tait looking for the short pitched delivery. His feet were just rooted in the crease there as he chased the ball away from his body Tait to Hall no run good pace right up there and scattering a cloud of dust as Hall edges that low on the front foot and unconvincingly down towards the slip region Hogg to Kemp no run up there again on middle and that s defended once more on the front foot again Hogg to Kemp no run pitches on middle moves to off and Kemp s not sure how to play that he tries to sweep doesn t really get hold of the ball Hogg to Kemp no run defended again Kemp not looking at all comfortable Hogg to Kemp wide wide down off Kemp backs away to give himself room to cut but that one went the other way and he was miles away from it Hogg to Kemp wide another wide down off. By George Hogg can t believe that one not sure why it was very wide Hogg to Kemp no run defended this time Hogg to Kemp no run comes forward and defends that one on the front foot. Not much fuss about that shot Tait to Hall no run awkward bounce to deal with that one but Hall stays cool as ever defending down off the back foot Tait to Hall run gets his yorker line all wrong and that s worked off the toes out to Mr Hussey Cricket on the deep square boundary and he does a slide and relay with McGrath Tait to Kemp no run left alone outside off this time Tait to Kemp no run better yorker this time obviously the length was right as before but this time it was on the toes and that s just defended forward Tait to Kemp no run bouncer down the channel and Kemp leaves that one alone Tait to Kemp no run another bouncer straight and that s well avoided Hogg to Hall no run tosses that one up it dips naughtily at the last minute and the batsman rolls out a tame forward drive Hogg to Hall run swished off the toes to short midwicket Hogg to Kemp no run right up there and there s a play and a miss Hogg to Kemp run some room outside off the batsman waits and cuts that away into the covers with a mere tuck of a cut Hogg to Hall run turning away towards off again this shot isn t so neat an ugly chop down yet again into the covers Tait to Nel OUT short and wide slashed high to backward point who backpeddled and took an easy catch above his head Tait to Kemp no run slower ball if you can describe mph as slower and Langeveldt into line to block Tait to Kemp no run faster and a bit shorter Langeveldt sways out of the way. It probably would have missed him anyway Tait to Kemp no run full Langeveldt winds up and drives the ball to Hogg at mid off Tait to Kemp wide Tait loses his bearings and spears one down the leg side Tait to Kemp no run full and this time on target Kemp defends Tait to Kemp run quite deliberately and safely steered down to third man. Kemp keeps the strike Watson to Kemp FOUR runs Watson attempts the yorker doesn t quite get it right and Kemp slams a full toss back over the bowler s head Watson to Kemp run full driven almost as hard but there is a long off in place Watson to Langeveldt no run Langeveldt heads towards the square leg umpire and blocks Watson to Langeveldt run decent ball which Langeveldt swings at hits and the ball arcs short of the man out in the deep on the off side Watson to Kemp FOUR runs another full toss from Watson which Kemp absolutely smears through extra cover Watson to Kemp no run slower ball but Kemp can t find the single he needs leaving Langeveldt exposed Tait to Hall OUT and Tait strikes again Hall looked to lash that off the back foot through cover but his feet must have been dipped in the same tub of superglue as Gibbs s as he strikes at the ball away from the body and a thickish edge rips through. Gilchrist makes no mistake Tait to Pollock no run oh Pollock was lucky to survive there this one nipping back in off the seam and Pollock doing his valiant best to give Gilchrist another catching opportunity but failed to get hold of it Tait to Pollock no run right up there and that s poked into the covers. A bit of shuffling from Hogg in his sunhat as he takes his time to throw down the stumps. It looked in and replays quickly confirmed it was Tait to Pollock run bouncer crashes into Pollock s gloves at just crouching height Pollock did well to shield his body there but he s not looking comfortable Tait to Kemp no run plays that away from his body poking it down to gully off the back foot Tait to Kemp no run more grunting from Tait and that s up there defended just outside off and just in front of yorker length Bracken to Pollock no run he s over the wicket and that s defended forward first up Bracken to Pollock no run across the righthander again and that s defended into the covers Bracken to Pollock no run on middle and off Pollock plays that into the covers in a very defensive manner Bracken to Pollock no run straight a touch short and defended easily enough on the back foot this time Bracken to Pollock no run outside off Pollock tries to cut that off the back foot through point but chops an inside edge down into the ground safely enough Bracken to Langeveldt run Langeveldt drops into the leg side and runs. McGrath teapots that the No. was allowed to get off strike first ball Bracken to Kemp run Kemp sweeps Bracken appeals thinking it missed the bat but Bucknor disagrees Bracken to Langeveldt no run driven into the covers Bracken to Langeveldt no run punched square on the off side Bracken to Langeveldt no run Langeveldt misses with a swish to leg strangled appeal as it again pitched outside the line Bracken to Langeveldt no run defended into the off side a quiet over but at least Kemp keeps the strike Watson to Kemp no run Kemp heaves over midwicket to Hayden in the deep but they decide not to run Watson to Kemp run driven straight to Tait at long on it went high but right to him. he caught it dropped it juggled the rebound before ending up in a big heap with the ball next to him Watson to Langeveldt no run a big heave and a big miss Watson to Langeveldt FOUR runs another heave from Langeveldt who is heading towards square leg as he plays it over point and over the rope Watson to Langeveldt OUT up in the block hole and Langeveldt again giving himself room is in no position to play it and is cleaned up That s South Africa s lowest score in the World Cup and Australia bounce off the field. On TV they are still pretending this game is well and truly alive but the reality is that it will take something remarkable to prevent Australia reaching the final now.

Sad news has just come in from Cricinfo s obituary expert Martin who tells us Arthur Milton has died. Pollock to open the bowling. Obviously. He hasn t defected to Australia . Blustery out there which could help him. Let s face it South Africa need all the assistance they can get Smith s hurt his leg there and immediately threw the ball into the ground. Hayden would never have played that shot had the target been rather than . Even he seemed to have enough. Pollock to Clarke no run slightly short cut hard to point Pollock to Clarke no run outside off Clarke looks to cut again misses and Boucher whips the bails off Pollock to Clarke run third time lucky outside off and this time Clarke finds the space running the ball down to third man Pollock to Clarke run Clarke stands tall and smacks the ball off the back foot through extra cover Pollock to Symonds no run firm drive but no run as he fails to find the gap either side of mid off Hall to Clarke no run half volley driven to Smith at mid on. Smith grimaces as he bends and switches to mid off hoping the ball doesn t go there Hall to Clarke no run back to the bowler much to Smith s relief Hall to Clarke run driven straight back to the right of Hall mid on scampers round to field. had Smith been there he would never have made it Hall to Symonds run Symonds back again this time he flicks it square on the leg to get off the mark Hall to Clarke FOUR runs Jenny purrs as Clarke eases the ball off his pads between mid on and midwicket. All so easy all so predictable Nel to Symonds FOUR runs horrible long hop which may have been an attempted bouncer from the snarling Nel Symonds smacks it dismissively through midwicket. Fetch Nel to Symonds run carved through the off side Nel stares and Symonds just trots past him without even giving him the time of day Nel to Clarke FOUR runs slashed over gully this time Nel to Clarke no run better ball on target and blocked Nel to Clarke no run outside off stump Clarke leaves it Nel to Clarke run outside off at mph Clarke hits it into the ground it dribbles into the off and they run a single Hall to Clarke run pushed back straight as an arrow mid on again has to make a fair amount of ground to his left to field Hall to Symonds no run Symonds half forward and drives hard to extra cover Hall to Symonds no run whipped off middle to midwicket Hall to Symonds no run dropped full and creamed back at Hall s midriff technically a chance but it was really travelling and at this stage of the game there s not much point in heroics Hall to Symonds no run Symonds much more circumspect after the let off Nel to Clarke no run driven into the ground and Nel takes at chest height in his follow through Nel to Clarke no run chipped to mid on in the air but Nel would have needed to be Spiderman to have got across to that Nel to Clarke no run wide and smeared to point where Gibbs makes a good stop diving to his right Nel to Clarke no run into the ground Clarke ponders the single but the ball went no more a yard in front of him and Nel was wise to what he was thinking Nel to Clarke FOUR runs hit on the up over mid on and that s his fifty off balls Nel to Clarke no run checked drive with a sniff of an inside edge to mid on Hall to Symonds no run straight and Symonds very respectfully blocks Hall to Symonds no run swished off middle to midwicket where Kallis makes a decent stop even though he overshot once he had got a hand to the ball Hall to Symonds runs clipped off leg stump to deep backward square leg Hall to Symonds run Symonds heaves towards midwicket get a thick edge and the ball scoots down to third man Hall to Clarke no run pushed to extra cover Hall to Clarke run Clarke takes a couple of steps and drives to mid on Langeveldt to Clarke runs controlled cut to third man Langeveldt to Clarke no run patted into the covers Langeveldt to Clarke no run yorker Clarke digs it out with a little sniff of lateness Langeveldt to Clarke no run outside off no contact Langeveldt to Clarke no run blocked to extra cover Hall to Symonds run worked through square leg Hall to Clarke FOUR runs Clarke gives himself room and cracks that back from where it came with interest Hall to Clarke no ball run driven past extra cover and a no ball Hall to Symonds FOUR runs leg side full toss Symonds does the business with a swish through midwicket and that s Australia into their fourth successive final Pollock to Hayden no run cut to point Pollock to Hayden runs oh but he s off the mark now. Hayden s had enough of this block prod block malarkey picking up this half volley and dispatching it over midwicket for four. Not pretty but very Hayden esque Pollock to Ponting run that s a terrific line from Pollock on off stump and Ponting pushes it just past the bowler immediately Ponting sets off for a run and gets it much to Pollock s disgust Pollock to Hayden no run a squirted smudged yet purposeful inside edge to mid on Pollock to Hayden no run good length just outside off and Hayden is resolute in defence Pollock to Hayden FOUR runs oh he s definitely had enough now Hayden. A stroke of brute ugly power heaving it through midwicket flat for four Kallis to Ponting no run a touch too wide but a good length Ponting defends off the back foot back to Kallis Kallis to Ponting no run too straight from Kallis on Ponting s middle stump and he flicks his wrists to midwicket setting off for a single before Hayden sends him back Kallis to Ponting no run another big stride down the pitch from Ponting creaming it to cover. He looks in absurd touch Kallis to Ponting no run good length just drawing Ponting forward at good pace too and Ponting cracks it on the front foot opening the face of the bat to Gibbs at point Kallis to Ponting no run driven to extra cover Kallis to Ponting no run a textbook cover drive but straight to mid off Nel to Hayden no run and it s defended off the back foot Nel to Hayden run banged in short but it s down the leg side and Hayden works it down to fine leg. Nel falls over in his follow through as he so often does Nel to Ponting FOUR runs terrible ball a massive wide which Ponting just leans into stroking it through cover bisecting mid off and cover and it races for four. Absolutely no chance of stopping that Nel to Ponting run ooh that s better from Nel a tighter line which forces Ponting to defend.though it s padded away and they pick up a single Nel to Hayden run but it s too straight Nel not able to adjust his line and Hayden clips a single to leg Nel to Ponting no run driven to mid off Kallis to Hayden wide good bounce from Kallis but oh dear it s very wide of the off stump and rightly wided by the not so wide umpire Kallis to Hayden no run ooh and a play and a miss outside off fuller this time from Kallis and Hayden tries to late cut but the ball kept a touch low Kallis to Hayden no run crunched on the front foot to cover Kallis to Hayden no run hammered My word he very nearly killed short extra cover. Andrew Hall the fielder there Kallis to Hayden FOUR runs grief that is some shot from Hayden. No great foot movement flicked on the up through mid on for four. Extraordinary shot in fact Kallis to Hayden run pushed to mid off this time and he sets off for a single Kallis to Ponting no run worked to leg but no single on offer Nel to Hayden no run defended on the front foot Nel to Hayden no run just a touch wide giving Hayden the room to free his arms and he strokes it to cover but Hall does magnificently to prevent the single. Or the two three or indeed four Nel to Hayden no run tighter line and a fuller length which Hayden back cuts to point Nel to Hayden runs on leg stump Hayden leans on it and clips it through midwicket. But the man at deep midwicket makes a fumble allowing them through for two. Hall is not pleased and the stump mic picks up every word Nel to Ponting wide wide of the off stump left alone.but it s a wide Nel to Ponting no run down on one knee Ponting carves it to cover Kallis to Hayden run swinging into Hayden who works it through midwicket Kallis to Clarke leg bye drifting down Clarke s leg side and he works it off his pads Kallis to Hayden FOUR runs absolutely magnificent shot. The power.just breathless. Perfectly reasonable ball Kallis to Hayden no run again monstrously struck but this time straight to mid off Kallis to Hayden no run timed off the back foot to extra cover Kallis to Hayden no run Hayden pulls but for once can t get hold of it Nel to Clarke no run shuffled through bustling effort but that s just left alone outside off Clarke with all the time in the world cue Louis Armstrong song music Nel to Clarke no run more leaving Nel to Clarke no run a bit of wobble and no dobble as that one nips back in and that s defended forward Nel to Clarke no run more leaving this time that one outside off Nel to Clarke FOUR runs nice shot to get off the mark leaning into that one outside off on the front foot and Nel s furious with himself Nel to Clarke no run outside off and that s just defended forward Kallis to Hayden runs over the wicket by the way that s poked into the covers for a quick single and there s a very close shy from ABCdEV. ooh. Overthrows result Kallis to Hayden run dabbed out off the back foot out to deep point where it s winged back in without much fuss Kallis to Clarke no run left alone outside off Kallis to Clarke no run hostile bouncer Kallis finding some spring there with one which whistles past the grille. Good bouncing there Kallis to Clarke no run a tamer one this just floating down the channel and it s left alone easily Nel to Hayden run driven straight to long off Nel to Clarke no run outside off and Clarke launches into a cover drive but he doesn t time it very well at all Nel to Clarke no run left alone outside off Nel to Clarke no run bustled through down the channel and Clarke leaves it alone again Nel to Clarke run outside off and Clarke drives that again without total timing to the covers Nel to Hayden no run round the wicket and that s eased into the covers Kallis to Clarke run just to say strays onto leg and that s tucked into square Kallis to Hayden leg byes outside leg that would have been good to a righthander but he s a lefty of course and that s pawed round through fine leg Kallis to Hayden no run a touch of width outside off Hayden connects cleanly and cuts that to gully Kallis to Hayden run quick single to mid off Kallis to Clarke run on leg and that s tucked forward with some excellent placement in front of midwicket Hayden turned down the second Kallis to Hayden no ball run on off and Hayden fails to pull that cleanly in front of square ah an overstepped no ball is signalled and he rehearses the shot when he makes it to the non striker s end Kallis to Clarke run on leg bounces up and that s tucked into short midwicket Nel to Clarke no run left alone outside off Nel to Clarke no run a touch of width outside off and that s cut to point Nel to Clarke no run outside off short and Nel s really pleased with himself jogging through and laughing like Muttley. Clarke goes to play and then drops his hands at the last minute Nel to Clarke no run outside off again driven to the covers and again it s all about waiting on Nel to Clarke no run on off and that s driven to the covers Nel to Clarke no run more of the off side stuff tidy and that s defended down Langeveldt to Hayden run up there on off and that s driven back out to mid on Langeveldt to Clarke no run outside off dragged down a touch and that s poked off the back foot to the covers Langeveldt to Clarke no run outside off and Clarke shuffles over with his pleasingly straight bat which he presents to the ball Langeveldt to Clarke run outside off and that s driven out to extra cover Langeveldt to Hayden no run on off and that s driven to short cover where it s picked up immediately Langeveldt to Hayden no run over the wicket incidentally and that s driven into the covers Hall to Clarke runs on leg and that s tucked in front of square Hall to Clarke no run on the money and that s driven to covers Hall to Clarke FOUR runs on leg and that s a lovely shot from Clarke timing that off his legs in front of midwicket Hall to Clarke run outside off eased through the covers Hall to Hayden run driven forward and there s a nice little single Hall to Clarke no run on leg and that s poked to short midwicket Langeveldt to Hayden no run comes from wide of the wicket and round too and that s defended forward Langeveldt to Hayden no run on the money on off and that s defended forward Langeveldt to Hayden run right up there and that s driven straight Langeveldt to Clarke run outside and that s thlocked out to the cover boundary with a caress of a nudge off the front foot Langeveldt to Hayden FOUR runs slower ball monstered through long off with a two bounce four doesn t even hang around to see where the ball went. Nonchalant or what Langeveldt to Hayden no run straight batted off the back foot to mid off Hall to Clarke no run up there and that s defended forward Hall to Clarke no run straight and played forward Hall to Clarke no run right up there and that s driven to mid off Hall to Clarke runs driven through the covers and that s two more rubbed off the target Hall to Clarke no run driven into the circle on the leg side and that s thrown back in Hall to Clarke FOUR runs outside off and that s driven through cover Langeveldt to Hayden run driven to wide mid on Langeveldt to Clarke no run driven to mid off Langeveldt to Clarke no run outside off and driven to cover Langeveldt to Clarke no run outside off down on one knee and that s driven to cover Langeveldt to Clarke FOUR runs slower ball lovely shot a languid punch through mid off Langeveldt to Clarke run tucked off the hips to square Hall to Clarke no run straight and blocked all very correct Hall to Clarke run driven to mid on and a quick single Pollock picks up and hurls the ball right into the ground in front of Boucher the kind of return that you see regularly in club cricket well at Merrow you do Hall to Hayden no run hit back hard at Hall on the half volley and he semi stops before ringing his hand in pain Hall to Hayden no run blocked to mid on about twice as hard as most people can drive it Pollock stops Hall to Hayden runs yorker which Hayden jams down on still managing to squeeze the ball into the leg side Hall to Hayden no run knee high full toss hit back to Hall who stick out his right hand and fields Kemp to Clarke no run very gentle loosener pushed into the off side Kemp to Clarke run drifts to leg and Clarke helps it on its way to long leg Kemp to Hayden no run prodded to mid off Kemp to Hayden no run patted to extra cover Kemp to Hayden no run defended into the off Kemp to Hayden no run full toss hammered straight at mid on. You can almost hear the purring in the commercial department at ICC Towers in Dubai Pollock to Clarke run half volley push driven to long on Pollock to Hayden run to describe this as pedestrian is an insult to pedestrians . patted to long off for variety Pollock to Clarke no run steered off the open face of the bat to point Pollock to Clarke run driven to long on Pollock to Hayden no run slightly shorter Hayden drops at his feet and looks for a quick single Clarke decides that would be too exciting and turns it down Pollock to Hayden runs clipped to deep midwicket where Nel is lurking both batsmen push for two from the off and make it with ease Kemp to Clarke runs leg side half volley clipped off his toes and Pollock has to chug round from long leg to field Kemp to Clarke no run well bowled . a yorker which Clarke dug out late Kemp to Clarke no run mistimed drive aimed at mid off and hit to mid on Kemp to Clarke no run flicked to mid on Kemp to Clarke no run firm drive back to Kemp the ball bounces kindly to him at midriff height Kemp to Clarke run leggish and Clarke sweetly whips that wide of midwicket and mid on has to scoot round to field Pollock to Clarke no run slightly short cut hard to point Pollock to Clarke no run outside off Clarke looks to cut again misses and Boucher whips the bails off Pollock to Clarke run third time lucky outside off and this time Clarke finds the space running the ball down to third man Pollock to Clarke run Clarke stands tall and smacks the ball off the back foot through extra cover Pollock to Symonds no run firm drive but no run as he fails to find the gap either side of mid off Hall to Clarke no run half volley driven to Smith at mid on. Smith grimaces as he bends and switches to mid off hoping the ball doesn t go there Hall to Clarke no run back to the bowler much to Smith s relief Hall to Clarke run driven straight back to the right of Hall mid on scampers round to field. had Smith been there he would never have made it Hall to Symonds run Symonds back again this time he flicks it square on the leg to get off the mark Hall to Clarke FOUR runs Jenny purrs as Clarke eases the ball off his pads between mid on and midwicket. All so easy all so predictable Nel to Symonds FOUR runs horrible long hop which may have been an attempted bouncer from the snarling Nel Symonds smacks it dismissively through midwicket. Fetch Nel to Symonds run carved through the off side Nel stares and Symonds just trots past him without even giving him the time of day Nel to Clarke FOUR runs slashed over gully this time Nel to Clarke no run better ball on target and blocked Nel to Clarke no run outside off stump Clarke leaves it Nel to Clarke run outside off at mph Clarke hits it into the ground it dribbles into the off and they run a single Hall to Clarke run pushed back straight as an arrow mid on again has to make a fair amount of ground to his left to field Hall to Symonds no run Symonds half forward and drives hard to extra cover Hall to Symonds no run whipped off middle to midwicket Hall to Symonds no run dropped full and creamed back at Hall s midriff technically a chance but it was really travelling and at this stage of the game there s not much point in heroics Hall to Symonds no run Symonds much more circumspect after the let off Nel to Clarke no run driven into the ground and Nel takes at chest height in his follow through Nel to Clarke no run chipped to mid on in the air but Nel would have needed to be Spiderman to have got across to that Nel to Clarke no run wide and smeared to point where Gibbs makes a good stop diving to his right Nel to Clarke no run into the ground Clarke ponders the single but the ball went no more a yard in front of him and Nel was wise to what he was thinking Nel to Clarke FOUR runs hit on the up over mid on and that s his fifty off balls Nel to Clarke no run checked drive with a sniff of an inside edge to mid on Hall to Symonds no run straight and Symonds very respectfully blocks Hall to Symonds no run swished off middle to midwicket where Kallis makes a decent stop even though he overshot once he had got a hand to the ball Hall to Symonds runs clipped off leg stump to deep backward square leg Hall to Symonds run Symonds heaves towards midwicket get a thick edge and the ball scoots down to third man Hall to Clarke no run pushed to extra cover Hall to Clarke run Clarke takes a couple of steps and drives to mid on Langeveldt to Clarke runs controlled cut to third man Langeveldt to Clarke no run patted into the covers Langeveldt to Clarke no run yorker Clarke digs it out with a little sniff of lateness Langeveldt to Clarke no run outside off no contact Langeveldt to Clarke no run blocked to extra cover Hall to Symonds run worked through square leg Hall to Clarke FOUR runs Clarke gives himself room and cracks that back from where it came with interest Hall to Clarke no ball run driven past extra cover and a no ball Hall to Symonds FOUR runs leg side full toss Symonds does the business with a swish through midwicket and that s Australia into their fourth successive final A clinical performance from the defending champions and the dominated this game from the off. The last few hours have been pretty poor for neutrals dreadful for South Africans but that s not Australia s fault. They have done the business and will meet Sri Lanka on Saturday in a re match of the final. Australia win by seven wickets The South Africans acknowledge the support they have received and then head off to lick their wounds the Australians amble onto the outfield and start a lap of honour. That s all from Jenny Thompson Will Luke and Martin Williamson. Many thanks for staying with us through a one sided match and we will be back along with Sriram Veera and Jamie Alter for Saturday s final. It s almost all over \n"
