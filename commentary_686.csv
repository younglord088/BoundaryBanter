7,"McGrath to Smith, 1 run Smith whips that from middle-and-leg into the on side, an easy run to the man in the deep"
8,"McGrath to de Villiers, 1 wide that started wide of off and swung significantly, an easy wide to call and Gilchrist had to scurry across to gather"

16,"Bracken to Kallis, no run Kallis spars and misses one outside off, much oohing and aahing among players, crowd and Cricinfo staff. 79mph for speed freaks."
17,"Bracken to Kallis, no run wider, and Kallis able to watch that pass"
18,"Bracken to Kallis, no run 82mph, and Kallis plays a slightly hurried defensive jab"

34,"McGrath to Gibbs, no run 84mph from McGrath. Either the old man is fired up or, as has happened a few times, the speed gun is up the creek. Anyhow, outside off and Gibbs watches and leaves"

48,"McGrath to de Villiers, 1 run de Villiers leaps out of his crease to meet the ball and square drives to the sweeper"
49,"Tait to de Villiers, FOUR runs Tait opens with a bouncer at 88mph, and it's almost as if de Villiers has been sent advanced notice, he's on it so fast and hammers that over midwicket"
50,"Tait to de Villiers, no run fired in at almost 93mph and de Villiers blocks off the back foot"
51,"Tait to de Villiers, no run slower ball - 91.9mph - and de Villiers is almost early on the attempted pull. It did keep low outside off ..."
52,"Tait to de Villiers, no run short - another 90mph+ delivery - and de Villiers sways back just in case"
53,"Tait to de Villiers, OUT full, de Villiers drives with no foot movement, and a thick kick carries straight to Gilchrist. A fourth delivery over 90mph, a good mixture of length, and now South Africa are up against it"
54,"Tait to Prince, no run right back and drops the ball at his feet"
55,"McGrath to Gibbs, no run McGrath seems almost a spinner after watching Tait ... good line, good length and defended"

57,"McGrath to Gibbs, 1 run McGrath drifts to leg - seriously - and Gibbs turns the ball just in front of square"
58,"McGrath to Prince, OUT And that might be it ... about the worst ball McGrath has bowled, wide and angled away from the left-hander, but Prince slashes, gets a thin edge, and Gilchrist does the rest"
59,"McGrath to Boucher, OUT McGrath on a hat-trick ... much better ball, a stock McGrath delivery, Boucher plays a nothing prod and the ball is held low down by Matthew Hayden at first slip"
60,"McGrath to Kemp, no run oh my goodness ... Kemp leaves and the ball passes knee-shakingly close to his off stump. Good judgment ... but a great over from McGrath."
61,"Tait to Gibbs, no run and another! But Bucknor doesn't raise his finger. A fierce inswinger as Gibbs goes right back, inside edges it to Gilchrist who tumbles to his left but...Bucknor refuses to raise his finger"
62,"Tait to Gibbs, FOUR runs and he crashes this on the front foot but it's just wide of the lone slip - and I reiterate, there's just one slip in there"
63,"Tait to Gibbs, FOUR runs fabulous shot. The most textbook of cover drives, creaming it on the front foot through extra cover"
64,"Tait to Gibbs, no run ooh well bowled, Tait, cutting this back into Gibbs who is back into his crease - rather late on it - defending off the back foot"
65,"Tait to Gibbs, no run shorter this time from Tait, and he grunts in doing so, forcing Gibbs back into his crease and he defends off the back foot"
66,"Tait to Gibbs, no run very well bowled from Tait, who has so far been far from the scattergun. In fact, he's been sniper-like: a 93.4mph (150ish kph) inswinger which Gibbs is very late on, nudging it to leg"
67,"McGrath to Kemp, 1 run Short and quick from McGrath"
68,"McGrath to Gibbs, no run classic McGrath, cutting this back into him and it's defended solidly"
69,"McGrath to Gibbs, no run right in the channel there, absolutely perfect line just outside off stump and he comes forward, rather tentatively, defending it back to McGrath"

71,"McGrath to Gibbs, no run ever so slightly wider from McGrath - the teaser"
72,"McGrath to Gibbs, no run Gibbs again leaves it alone outside off"

75,"Tait to Gibbs, no run ah, very good comeback from Tait just pitching it up a smidgen more"
76,"Tait to Gibbs, 1 run oh hello, a Tait slower ball. That's new - or at least, I've not seen it much before. Gibbs reads it, though, and on the front foot neatly guides it down to third man with surprising deftness"
77,"Tait to Kemp, 5 wide oh dear, Tait's replaced his sniper rifle with the greater-spotted potato gun. This is miles down the leg side and Gilchrist doesn't have a chance"
78,"Tait to Kemp, no run on off stump this time, much better, and it's firmly defended"
79,"Tait to Kemp, no run cracking ball, at high pace, swinging into the right hander who digs it out at the very last moment. A yorker, in fact"
80,"Bracken to Gibbs, 1 run and he starts lazily, drifting it down the leg side and Gibbs plucks it with ease to leg"
81,"Bracken to Kemp, 1 run ooh close! A lovely delivery angling across a very nervous Justin Kemp who, even more nervously, pushes forward without conviction and edges it past the second slip"
82,"Bracken to Gibbs, no run defended on the front foot"
83,"Bracken to Gibbs, 1 run ah, delightful shot, coming forward on the front foot and just working it - smudging it - through midwicket"
84,"Bracken to Kemp, no run gets into a bit of a tangle, Kemp, here. A shorter delivery which rises up on him and he defends, using his chest"
85,"Watson to Gibbs, FOUR runs what a magnificent shot from Gibbs, a flick behind square which beats the man at deep square leg"
86,"Watson to Gibbs, no run and Gibbs drives with vast amounts of class here, but straight to cover"
87,"Watson to Gibbs, no run much better from Watson - that's the length and it's pumped back to the bowler"
88,"Watson to Gibbs, no run just a little wider this time from Watson and Gibbs is back-and-across, pushing it out to cover"
89,"Watson to Gibbs, 1 run a Watson slower-ball which is nicely nudged off the front foot down to fine leg"
90,"Watson to Kemp, no run Kemp is less deft, but he defends with a solid lunge of the front foot and pushes this back to the bowler"
91,"Hogg to Gibbs, no run quick, on middle-and-leg and it's worked further to leg"
92,"Hogg to Gibbs, 1 run again on leg stump - quick and flat - turned around the corner"
93,"Hogg to Kemp, no run well bowled, on middle stump and Kemp comes forward - massively - defending it on the front foot"
94,"Hogg to Kemp, no run that's more like it from Kemp, hammering it on the front foot and timing it very well but straight to cover"
95,"Hogg to Kemp, no run what a ball from the tongue-master, a wrong'un which Kemp complete misreads, coming forward, trying to defend, but missing it by a country mile"
96,"Hogg to Kemp, no run and again he's beaten"
97,"Watson to Gibbs, FOUR runs poor delivery, short and straight, Gibbs pulling it behind square"
98,"Watson to Gibbs, no run better"

101,"Watson to Gibbs, 1 run calmly strokes past short extra cover"
102,"Watson to Kemp, 1 run on middle-and-off, Kemp lunges forward like a monster and defends"
103,"Hogg to Kemp, 2 runs poor ball outside leg, deftly paddled around the corner"
104,"Hogg to Kemp, 1 run very well played again, straighter this time and he plants his foot down the pitch and ladles it around the corner"
105,"Hogg to Gibbs, 1 run flicked through midwicket"
106,"Hogg to Kemp, no run blocked out on the front foot"
107,"Hogg to Kemp, 1 run a full bunger from Hogg, punched through cover - rather takes Kemp by surprise, hence not trying to hit it into the USA"
108,"Watson to Kemp, no run defended on the front foot"
109,"Watson to Kemp, no run excellent ball on off stump and he comes forward to defend this out to cover"
110,"Watson to Kemp, no run ah, now then - that's more like it from Watson. An excellent bouncer which takes the batsman by surprise, as he attempts to pull before deciding to leave it well alone"
111,"Watson to Kemp, 2 runs Kemp late-cuts this with oodles of time, and class, behind point and wide of third man who sprints to his right to field"
112,"Watson to Kemp, no run swinging into him, it's defended on the front foot"
113,"Watson to Kemp, no run another good one just outside off. Watson bowling with excellent control so far and it's blocked out"
114,"Hogg to Gibbs, 1 run on leg stump, picked off for a single"
115,"Hogg to Kemp, no run ooh, this one holds up on him - just outside off, spinning back into him and jumping up a touch, it's blocked out"
116,"Hogg to Kemp, no run full and straight, blocked out"
117,"Hogg to Kemp, no run and he plays and misses outside off - the arm ball there"
118,"Hogg to Kemp, 1 run on leg stump - flatter and quicker and defended"
119,"Hogg to Gibbs, no run beaten! Terrific ball, the wrong'un which he plays at and misses, Hogg's tongue slavers around uncontrollably"
120,"Watson to Kemp, no run on leg and that's skewed in front of square to the man there"
121,"Watson to Kemp, no run slower ball, on the money, and that's defended forward"
122,"Watson to Kemp, no run beautiful delivery that one, nipping back in at the righthander and threatening to kiss the outside edge"
123,"Watson to Kemp, no run left alone this time"
124,"Watson to Kemp, SIX runs short and Kemp's on that one so quickly, fending the ball with a hook right off his helmet - top work, that was close to him, and although he didn't get hold of it properlyit sailed away. And that's the fifty partnership"
125,"Watson to Kemp, no run defended off the back foot into the covers"
126,"Hogg to Gibbs, 1 run on leg, the batsman comes forward and sweeps that round on the front foot behind square"
127,"Hogg to Kemp, 1 run swept that round behind square"
128,"Hogg to Gibbs, no run the one that went the other way - the ball, not his tongue - and that slavers outside off and is left alone easily"
129,"Hogg to Gibbs, 1 run another ball on leg, another sweep, this one dinked as gentle as the others"
130,"Hogg to Kemp, 1 run on middle, doesn't read that one, and a tentative prod from Kemp sends an outside edge backward of point"
131,"Hogg to Gibbs, 1 wide outside leg, chased round, and that's just to say wide"
132,"Hogg to Gibbs, 1 run on leg and that turns towards leg even more, the batsman just poking that into short square"
133,"Tait to Gibbs, no run bouncer, straight and high. Tait follows through with a serious look on his face - he means more business here all right"
134,"Tait to Gibbs, FOUR runs outside off, way too much width and Gibbs just opens his shoulders and swings hard, and that one flies up off the base of the bat behind point, not quite where he intended it, but it fair raced away"
135,"Tait to Gibbs, no run pushes him back up there to defend into the covers"
136,"Tait to Gibbs, OUT got him this time! A very, very thin edge - much thinner than the one which wasn't given earlier, also to Tait - looking for the short-pitched delivery. His feet were just rooted in the crease there as he chased the ball away from his body"
137,"Tait to Hall, no run good pace, right up there and scattering a cloud of dust as Hall edges that low, on the front foot, and unconvincingly down towards the slip region"
138,"Hogg to Kemp, no run up there again, on middle, and that's defended once more, on the front foot again"
139,"Hogg to Kemp, no run pitches on middle, moves to off and Kemp's not sure how to play that - he tries to sweep, doesn't really get hold of the ball"
140,"Hogg to Kemp, no run defended again, Kemp not looking at all comfortable"
141,"Hogg to Kemp, 1 wide wide down off, Kemp backs away to give himself room to cut, but that one went the other way and he was miles away from it"
142,"Hogg to Kemp, 1 wide another wide down off. By George! Hogg can't believe that one - not sure why, it was very wide"
143,"Hogg to Kemp, no run defended this time"
144,"Hogg to Kemp, no run comes forward and defends that one on the front foot. Not much fuss about that shot"
145,"Tait to Hall, no run awkward bounce to deal with that one, but Hall stays cool as ever defending down off the back foot"
146,"Tait to Hall, 1 run gets his yorker line all wrong, and that's worked off the toes out to Mr Hussey-Cricket on the deep square boundary and he does a slide and relay with McGrath"
147,"Tait to Kemp, no run left alone outside off this time"
148,"Tait to Kemp, no run better yorker this time, obviously the length was right as before, but this time it was on the toes and that's just defended forward"
149,"Tait to Kemp, no run bouncer down the channel and Kemp leaves that one alone"
150,"Tait to Kemp, no run another bouncer, straight, and that's well avoided"
151,"Hogg to Hall, no run tosses that one up, it dips naughtily at the last minute and the batsman rolls out a tame forward drive"
152,"Hogg to Hall, 1 run swished off the toes to short midwicket"
153,"Hogg to Kemp, no run right up there and there's a play and a miss"
154,"Hogg to Kemp, 1 run some room outside off, the batsman waits and cuts that away into the covers with a mere tuck of a cut"
155,"Hogg to Hall, 1 run turning away towards off again, this shot isn't so neat, an ugly chop down, yet again into the covers"
156,"Tait to Nel, OUT short and wide, slashed high to backward point who backpeddled and took an easy catch above his head"
157,"Tait to Kemp, no run slower ball - if you can describe 81mph as slower - and Langeveldt into line to block"
158,"Tait to Kemp, no run faster and a bit shorter, Langeveldt sways out of the way. It probably would have missed him anyway"
159,"Tait to Kemp, no run full, Langeveldt winds up and drives the ball to Hogg at mid-off"
160,"Tait to Kemp, 1 wide Tait loses his bearings and spears one down the leg side"
161,"Tait to Kemp, no run full and this time on target, Kemp defends"
162,"Tait to Kemp, 1 run quite deliberately and safely steered down to third man. Kemp keeps the strike"
163,"Watson to Kemp, FOUR runs Watson attempts the yorker, doesn't quite get it right and Kemp slams a full toss back over the bowler's head"
164,"Watson to Kemp, 1 run full, driven almost as hard but there is a long-off in place"
165,"Watson to Langeveldt, no run Langeveldt heads towards the square-leg umpire and blocks"
166,"Watson to Langeveldt, 1 run decent ball which Langeveldt swings at, hits, and the ball arcs short of the man out in the deep on the off side"
167,"Watson to Kemp, FOUR runs another full toss from Watson which Kemp absolutely smears through extra cover"
168,"Watson to Kemp, no run slower ball but Kemp can't find the single he needs, leaving Langeveldt exposed"
169,"Tait to Hall, OUT and Tait strikes again! Hall looked to lash that off the back foot through cover, but his feet must have been dipped in the same tub of superglue as Gibbs's as he strikes at the ball away from the body and a thickish edge rips through. Gilchrist makes no mistake"
170,"Tait to Pollock, no run oh, Pollock was lucky to survive there, this one nipping back in off the seam and Pollock doing his valiant best to give Gilchrist another catching opportunity - but failed to get hold of it"
171,"Tait to Pollock, no run right up there and that's poked into the covers. A bit of shuffling from Hogg in his sunhat as he takes his time to throw down the stumps. It looked in, and replays quickly confirmed it was"
172,"Tait to Pollock, 1 run bouncer crashes into Pollock's gloves at just-crouching height - Pollock did well to shield his body there, but he's not looking comfortable"
173,"Tait to Kemp, no run plays that away from his body, poking it down to gully off the back foot"
174,"Tait to Kemp, no run more grunting from Tait, and that's up there, defended just outside off and just in front of yorker length"

180,"Bracken to Langeveldt, 1 run Langeveldt drops into the leg side and runs. McGrath teapots that the No. 11 was allowed to get off strike first ball"

184,"Bracken to Langeveldt, no run Langeveldt misses with a swish to leg, strangled appeal as it again pitched outside the line"

191,"Bracken to Smith, 1 run uppish and loose pushed drive, in the air but into space, third man fields"
192,"Bracken to de Villiers, no run wide of off stump, plenty of swing, aided by a stiff breeze, and de Villiers leaves"
193,"Bracken to de Villiers, no run again that swung into the right-hander, de Villiers into line and drops into the leg side"

238,"McGrath to de Villiers, 1 run de Villiers leaps out of his crease to meet the ball and square drives to the sweeper"
239,"Tait to de Villiers, FOUR runs Tait opens with a bouncer at 88mph, and it's almost as if de Villiers has been sent advanced notice, he's on it so fast and hammers that over midwicket"
240,"Tait to de Villiers, no run fired in at almost 93mph and de Villiers blocks off the back foot"
241,"Tait to de Villiers, no run slower ball - 91.9mph - and de Villiers is almost early on the attempted pull. It did keep low outside off ..."
242,"Tait to de Villiers, no run short - another 90mph+ delivery - and de Villiers sways back just in case"
243,"Tait to de Villiers, OUT full, de Villiers drives with no foot movement, and a thick kick carries straight to Gilchrist. A fourth delivery over 90mph, a good mixture of length, and now South Africa are up against it"
244,"Tait to Prince, no run right back and drops the ball at his feet"
245,"McGrath to Gibbs, no run McGrath seems almost a spinner after watching Tait ... good line, good length and defended"

247,"McGrath to Gibbs, 1 run McGrath drifts to leg - seriously - and Gibbs turns the ball just in front of square"
248,"McGrath to Prince, OUT And that might be it ... about the worst ball McGrath has bowled, wide and angled away from the left-hander, but Prince slashes, gets a thin edge, and Gilchrist does the rest"
249,"McGrath to Boucher, OUT McGrath on a hat-trick ... much better ball, a stock McGrath delivery, Boucher plays a nothing prod and the ball is held low down by Matthew Hayden at first slip"
250,"McGrath to Kemp, no run oh my goodness ... Kemp leaves and the ball passes knee-shakingly close to his off stump. Good judgment ... but a great over from McGrath."
251,"Tait to Gibbs, no run and another! But Bucknor doesn't raise his finger. A fierce inswinger as Gibbs goes right back, inside edges it to Gilchrist who tumbles to his left but...Bucknor refuses to raise his finger"
252,"Tait to Gibbs, FOUR runs and he crashes this on the front foot but it's just wide of the lone slip - and I reiterate, there's just one slip in there"
253,"Tait to Gibbs, FOUR runs fabulous shot. The most textbook of cover drives, creaming it on the front foot through extra cover"
254,"Tait to Gibbs, no run ooh well bowled, Tait, cutting this back into Gibbs who is back into his crease - rather late on it - defending off the back foot"
255,"Tait to Gibbs, no run shorter this time from Tait, and he grunts in doing so, forcing Gibbs back into his crease and he defends off the back foot"
256,"Tait to Gibbs, no run very well bowled from Tait, who has so far been far from the scattergun. In fact, he's been sniper-like: a 93.4mph (150ish kph) inswinger which Gibbs is very late on, nudging it to leg"
257,"McGrath to Kemp, 1 run Short and quick from McGrath"
258,"McGrath to Gibbs, no run classic McGrath, cutting this back into him and it's defended solidly"

261,"McGrath to Gibbs, no run ever so slightly wider from McGrath - the teaser"
262,"McGrath to Gibbs, no run Gibbs again leaves it alone outside off"
263,"Tait to Kemp, 1 leg bye Another prehistoric grunt from Tait as he flings this down - but it's a little too straight and worked off his pads"
264,"Tait to Gibbs, FOUR runs outside off, Gibbs plants his foot and slashes it over the slips - not far off at all"
265,"Tait to Gibbs, no run ah, very good comeback from Tait just pitching it up a smidgen more"
266,"Tait to Gibbs, 1 run oh hello, a Tait slower ball. That's new - or at least, I've not seen it much before. Gibbs reads it, though, and on the front foot neatly guides it down to third man with surprising deftness"
267,"Tait to Kemp, 5 wide oh dear, Tait's replaced his sniper rifle with the greater-spotted potato gun. This is miles down the leg side and Gilchrist doesn't have a chance"
268,"Tait to Kemp, no run on off stump this time, much better, and it's firmly defended"
269,"Tait to Kemp, no run cracking ball, at high pace, swinging into the right hander who digs it out at the very last moment. A yorker, in fact"
270,"Bracken to Gibbs, 1 run and he starts lazily, drifting it down the leg side and Gibbs plucks it with ease to leg"
271,"Bracken to Kemp, 1 run ooh close! A lovely delivery angling across a very nervous Justin Kemp who, even more nervously, pushes forward without conviction and edges it past the second slip"
272,"Bracken to Gibbs, no run defended on the front foot"
273,"Bracken to Gibbs, 1 run ah, delightful shot, coming forward on the front foot and just working it - smudging it - through midwicket"
274,"Bracken to Kemp, no run gets into a bit of a tangle, Kemp, here. A shorter delivery which rises up on him and he defends, using his chest"
275,"Watson to Gibbs, FOUR runs what a magnificent shot from Gibbs, a flick behind square which beats the man at deep square leg"
276,"Watson to Gibbs, no run and Gibbs drives with vast amounts of class here, but straight to cover"
277,"Watson to Gibbs, no run much better from Watson - that's the length and it's pumped back to the bowler"
278,"Watson to Gibbs, no run just a little wider this time from Watson and Gibbs is back-and-across, pushing it out to cover"
279,"Watson to Gibbs, 1 run a Watson slower-ball which is nicely nudged off the front foot down to fine leg"
280,"Watson to Kemp, no run Kemp is less deft, but he defends with a solid lunge of the front foot and pushes this back to the bowler"
281,"Hogg to Gibbs, no run quick, on middle-and-leg and it's worked further to leg"
282,"Hogg to Gibbs, 1 run again on leg stump - quick and flat - turned around the corner"
283,"Hogg to Kemp, no run well bowled, on middle stump and Kemp comes forward - massively - defending it on the front foot"
284,"Hogg to Kemp, no run that's more like it from Kemp, hammering it on the front foot and timing it very well but straight to cover"
285,"Hogg to Kemp, no run what a ball from the tongue-master, a wrong'un which Kemp complete misreads, coming forward, trying to defend, but missing it by a country mile"
286,"Hogg to Kemp, no run and again he's beaten"
287,"Watson to Gibbs, FOUR runs poor delivery, short and straight, Gibbs pulling it behind square"
288,"Watson to Gibbs, no run better"
289,"Watson to Gibbs, no run good idea from Watson, who increasingly resembles the incredible hulk, bouncing the batsman...but he's pretty settled now, ducking underneath it easily"

293,"Hogg to Kemp, 2 runs poor ball outside leg, deftly paddled around the corner"

296,"Hogg to Kemp, no run blocked out on the front foot"
297,"Hogg to Kemp, 1 run a full bunger from Hogg, punched through cover - rather takes Kemp by surprise, hence not trying to hit it into the USA"

299,"Watson to Kemp, no run excellent ball on off stump and he comes forward to defend this out to cover"
300,"Watson to Kemp, no run ah, now then - that's more like it from Watson. An excellent bouncer which takes the batsman by surprise, as he attempts to pull before deciding to leave it well alone"
301,"Watson to Kemp, 2 runs Kemp late-cuts this with oodles of time, and class, behind point and wide of third man who sprints to his right to field"
302,"Watson to Kemp, no run swinging into him, it's defended on the front foot"

304,"Hogg to Gibbs, 1 run on leg stump, picked off for a single"
305,"Hogg to Kemp, no run ooh, this one holds up on him - just outside off, spinning back into him and jumping up a touch, it's blocked out"
306,"Hogg to Kemp, no run full and straight, blocked out"
307,"Hogg to Kemp, no run and he plays and misses outside off - the arm ball there"
308,"Hogg to Kemp, 1 run on leg stump - flatter and quicker and defended"
309,"Hogg to Gibbs, no run beaten! Terrific ball, the wrong'un which he plays at and misses, Hogg's tongue slavers around uncontrollably"
310,"Watson to Kemp, no run on leg and that's skewed in front of square to the man there"
311,"Watson to Kemp, no run slower ball, on the money, and that's defended forward"
312,"Watson to Kemp, no run beautiful delivery that one, nipping back in at the righthander and threatening to kiss the outside edge"
313,"Watson to Kemp, no run left alone this time"
314,"Watson to Kemp, SIX runs short and Kemp's on that one so quickly, fending the ball with a hook right off his helmet - top work, that was close to him, and although he didn't get hold of it properlyit sailed away. And that's the fifty partnership"
315,"Watson to Kemp, no run defended off the back foot into the covers"
316,"Hogg to Gibbs, 1 run on leg, the batsman comes forward and sweeps that round on the front foot behind square"
317,"Hogg to Kemp, 1 run swept that round behind square"

322,"Hogg to Gibbs, 1 run on leg and that turns towards leg even more, the batsman just poking that into short square"
323,"Tait to Gibbs, no run bouncer, straight and high. Tait follows through with a serious look on his face - he means more business here all right"
324,"Tait to Gibbs, FOUR runs outside off, way too much width and Gibbs just opens his shoulders and swings hard, and that one flies up off the base of the bat behind point, not quite where he intended it, but it fair raced away"
325,"Tait to Gibbs, no run pushes him back up there to defend into the covers"
326,"Tait to Gibbs, OUT got him this time! A very, very thin edge - much thinner than the one which wasn't given earlier, also to Tait - looking for the short-pitched delivery. His feet were just rooted in the crease there as he chased the ball away from his body"
327,"Tait to Hall, no run good pace, right up there and scattering a cloud of dust as Hall edges that low, on the front foot, and unconvincingly down towards the slip region"
328,"Hogg to Kemp, no run up there again, on middle, and that's defended once more, on the front foot again"
329,"Hogg to Kemp, no run pitches on middle, moves to off and Kemp's not sure how to play that - he tries to sweep, doesn't really get hold of the ball"
330,"Hogg to Kemp, no run defended again, Kemp not looking at all comfortable"
331,"Hogg to Kemp, 1 wide wide down off, Kemp backs away to give himself room to cut, but that one went the other way and he was miles away from it"

333,"Hogg to Kemp, no run defended this time"
334,"Hogg to Kemp, no run comes forward and defends that one on the front foot. Not much fuss about that shot"
335,"Tait to Hall, no run awkward bounce to deal with that one, but Hall stays cool as ever defending down off the back foot"
336,"Tait to Hall, 1 run gets his yorker line all wrong, and that's worked off the toes out to Mr Hussey-Cricket on the deep square boundary and he does a slide and relay with McGrath"
337,"Tait to Kemp, no run left alone outside off this time"
338,"Tait to Kemp, no run better yorker this time, obviously the length was right as before, but this time it was on the toes and that's just defended forward"

340,"Tait to Kemp, no run another bouncer, straight, and that's well avoided"

343,"Hogg to Kemp, no run right up there and there's a play and a miss"
344,"Hogg to Kemp, 1 run some room outside off, the batsman waits and cuts that away into the covers with a mere tuck of a cut"
345,"Hogg to Hall, 1 run turning away towards off again, this shot isn't so neat, an ugly chop down, yet again into the covers"
346,"Tait to Nel, OUT short and wide, slashed high to backward point who backpeddled and took an easy catch above his head"
347,"Tait to Kemp, no run slower ball - if you can describe 81mph as slower - and Langeveldt into line to block"
348,"Tait to Kemp, no run faster and a bit shorter, Langeveldt sways out of the way. It probably would have missed him anyway"
349,"Tait to Kemp, no run full, Langeveldt winds up and drives the ball to Hogg at mid-off"
350,"Tait to Kemp, 1 wide Tait loses his bearings and spears one down the leg side"
351,"Tait to Kemp, no run full and this time on target, Kemp defends"
352,"Tait to Kemp, 1 run quite deliberately and safely steered down to third man. Kemp keeps the strike"
353,"Watson to Kemp, FOUR runs Watson attempts the yorker, doesn't quite get it right and Kemp slams a full toss back over the bowler's head"
354,"Watson to Kemp, 1 run full, driven almost as hard but there is a long-off in place"
355,"Watson to Langeveldt, no run Langeveldt heads towards the square-leg umpire and blocks"
356,"Watson to Langeveldt, 1 run decent ball which Langeveldt swings at, hits, and the ball arcs short of the man out in the deep on the off side"
357,"Watson to Kemp, FOUR runs another full toss from Watson which Kemp absolutely smears through extra cover"
358,"Watson to Kemp, no run slower ball but Kemp can't find the single he needs, leaving Langeveldt exposed"
359,"Tait to Hall, OUT and Tait strikes again! Hall looked to lash that off the back foot through cover, but his feet must have been dipped in the same tub of superglue as Gibbs's as he strikes at the ball away from the body and a thickish edge rips through. Gilchrist makes no mistake"
360,"Tait to Pollock, no run oh, Pollock was lucky to survive there, this one nipping back in off the seam and Pollock doing his valiant best to give Gilchrist another catching opportunity - but failed to get hold of it"
361,"Tait to Pollock, no run right up there and that's poked into the covers. A bit of shuffling from Hogg in his sunhat as he takes his time to throw down the stumps. It looked in, and replays quickly confirmed it was"
362,"Tait to Pollock, 1 run bouncer crashes into Pollock's gloves at just-crouching height - Pollock did well to shield his body there, but he's not looking comfortable"
363,"Tait to Kemp, no run plays that away from his body, poking it down to gully off the back foot"
364,"Tait to Kemp, no run more grunting from Tait, and that's up there, defended just outside off and just in front of yorker length"

366,"Bracken to Pollock, no run across the righthander again and that's defended into the covers"

370,"Bracken to Langeveldt, 1 run Langeveldt drops into the leg side and runs. McGrath teapots that the No. 11 was allowed to get off strike first ball"

374,"Bracken to Langeveldt, no run Langeveldt misses with a swish to leg, strangled appeal as it again pitched outside the line"

390,Smith's hurt his leg there and immediately threw the ball into the ground. Hayden would never have played that shot had the target been 250 rather than 150. Even he seemed to have enough.

400,"Hall to Clarke, FOUR runs Jenny purrs as Clarke eases the ball off his pads between mid-on and midwicket. All so easy, all so predictable"
401,"Nel to Symonds, FOUR runs horrible long-hop which may have been an attempted bouncer from the snarling Nel, Symonds smacks it dismissively through midwicket. Fetch"
